### [MS Minor in Data Science Analytics](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/Academics/departments/Biostatistics/Academics/Pages/MS-Emphasis-in-Data-Science-Analytics.aspx)

There is a new minor within the Biostatistics MS degree program in Data Science Analytics.

We offer this new minor in response to the changing landscape of biomedical research which is relying more and more on the generation, analysis and interpretation of large data sets.  With this new minor, students pursuing this training within the MS Biostatistics program will have an official designation within their degree, which will help with employment and other opportunities.

**Eligibility**

MS students and PhD students who are in the process of obtaining a MS degree are eligible.  It is best to plan out the minor starting the first year to ensure timely graduation and availability of electives.

**Requirements**

* Take 9 credits of electives from a list of courses related to Data Science Analytics \(see below\).  There are additional elective credits required in the minor compared to the original MS degree, so that there is opportunity to specialize in this area.
* Write a thesis or publishable paper with a focus on Data Science Analytics.

**Timeline**

The Biostatistics MS degree is designed to be completed in two academic years.  Although the minor requires additional credits for the specialization, the degree can still be completed within two years assuming students take courses over the summer.  See an example timeline below \(individual cases and offerings every year will vary\).
