[Business Analytics](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Master-of-Science-in-Business-Analytics/Academics/Curriculum)

The MSBA curriculum is designed to let students complete their 36 credit hours and receive their STEM Certified MSBA degree in just 10 months. Our program's coursework is made up of three main components:   


* Foundation: Ensure proficiency in the technical skills needed in the fast-paced field of Business Analytics
* Application: Go beyond theories and concepts to see you how your new skills are currently being applied
* Demonstration: Go out of the classroom and work with real companies on their current projects, giving you real world experience

The opportunity to take up to six credit hours outside of your program offerings is possible on an as available basis.

        <p>This course will involve the study of a variety of techniques for predictive
          analytics. Particular emphasis will be given to approaches that are scalable
          to very large data sets and/or those that are relatively robust when faced
          with a large number of predictors, and algorithms for heterogeneous or
          streaming data. Many of these capabilities are essential for handing BIG
          DATA. Connections to relevant business problems shall be made via example
          studies. We will mostly be using Python (specially Scikit-Learn). The central
          goal of this course is to convey an understanding of the pros and cons
          of different predictive modeling techniques, so that you can (i) make an
          informed decision on what approaches to consider when faced with real-life
          problems requiring predictive modeling, (ii) apply models properly on real
          datasets so to make valid conclusions. This goal will be reinforced through
          both theory and hands-on experience.</p>

        <p>Data-driven analysis has wrought a quiet revolution in business. As disk
          storage and computing power have become cheaper, companies have started
          maintaining detailed logs of inventories, sales, and customer activity,
          among others. Yet, this is only half the job; the real need is for insights,
          and this course teaches you the tools for that. This course uses Python
          &amp; Pandas.</p>

          In this course, we will consider analytics applied to important problems
          found in the management of supply chains. The first half of the course
          introduces the context for application of analytics in operations. The
          second half of the course addresses use of analytics in supply chain management.</p>

        <p>This course is an introduction to quantitative decision making. Quantitative
          decision making adds value to data by using it to build models that can
          help in the decision making process. We will cover decision analysis and
          Monte Carlo simulation. This will be followed by a second course in the
          spring on mathematical programming including linear programming, non-linear
          programming and integer programming. The focus in both courses will be
          on model formulation and intuition behind the solution techniques rather
          than the mathematical theory. Formal math skills like calculus, linear
          algebra, and probability/statistics will be used some but not much. You
          do need the ability to think logically and systematically, but improving
          this ability is a course goal. The course will also introduce students
          to some advanced commercial software that supports the development of these
          models.</p>
