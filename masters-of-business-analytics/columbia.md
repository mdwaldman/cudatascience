[Columbia Engineering](https://gradengineering.columbia.edu/) and [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/) have announced a new full-time Master of Science in Business Analytics degree, with a three-semester curriculum designed for those who want to focus on learning the modeling techniques and data science tools that help businesses use data to make better decisions. A key element of the new degree program is a capstone project that provides an intense consulting engagement with clients and their real-world business problems using relevant data sets over the entire course of the three-semester study.

“The role of analytics has grown increasingly critical for most sectors of the economy,” said [Mary C. Boyce](https://gradengineering.columbia.edu/dean-mary-c-boyce), Dean of Columbia Engineering. “Our partnership with Columbia Business School combines our strength in data science, optimization, stochastic modeling, and analytics with their strength in data-driven decision-making for business and marketing to create a rigorous new Master’s degree program.“

**ABOUT COLUMBIA ENGINEERING**

Columbia Engineering, based in New York City, is one of the top engineering schools in the U.S. and one of the oldest in the nation. Also known as The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School expands knowledge and advances technology through the pioneering research of its more than 200 faculty, while educating undergraduate and graduate students in a collaborative environment to become leaders informed by a firm foundation in engineering. The School’s faculty are at the center of the University’s cross-disciplinary research, contributing to the Data Science Institute, Earth Institute, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Columbia Nano Initiative. Guided by its strategic vision, “Columbia Engineering for Humanity,” the School aims to translate ideas into innovations that foster a sustainable, healthy, secure, connected, and creative humanity.

**ABOUT COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL**

Columbia Business School is the only world-class, Ivy League business school that delivers a learning experience where academic excellence meets with real-time exposure to the pulse of global business. Led by Dean Glenn Hubbard, the School’s transformative curriculum bridges academic theory with unparalleled exposure to real-world business practice, equipping students with an entrepreneurial mindset that allows them to recognize, capture, and create opportunity in any business environment. The thought leadership of the School’s faculty and staff members, combined with the accomplishments of its distinguished alumni and position in the center of global business, means that the School’s efforts have an immediate, measurable impact on the forces shaping business every day.

The new MS in Business Analytics, developed in part by IEOR chair Garud Iyengar \(left\), equips graduates with a deep understanding of data analytics and its practical applications.

Jointly developed by faculty at both Columbia Engineering and Columbia Business School, the MS in Business Analytics equips graduates for careers as analysts and associates in consulting firms, and business analysts and data scientists in the fields of financial and professional services, technology, advertising and media, and other professions where a deep understanding and practical application of data analytics are required.

“By tapping into the vibrant and diverse business ecosystem that can only be found in New York, Columbia Business School and Columbia Engineering are uniquely situated to offer this new Master’s degree,” said Glenn Hubbard, Dean of Columbia Business School. “We see this as a must-do program for any future business person who wants to have a leg up in using data to make informed business decisions.”

[Garud Iyengar](http://ieor.columbia.edu/garud-n-iyengar), professor and chair of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research in Columbia Engineering; Costis Maglaras, professor and chair of Columbia Business School’s Decisions, Risk & Operations Division; and Kamel Jedidi, professor and chair of its Marketing Division, developed the curriculum and will teach in the program, along with other Columbia professors and industry practitioners.

One distinguishing feature of the MS in Business Analytics is the capstone project. From their first semester, students in the program work on consulting projects with companies using their own data.  “By working on real-world consulting projects, with real-world data, students will use the modeling techniques and data science tools to provide pragmatic solutions to the practical problems that businesses are facing today,” said Maglaras.

“Ever-increasing amounts of data have transformed marketing into a data-driven field,” added Jedidi. “Marketing and advertising have evolved rapidly and are continuing to change, which makes a foundation in business analytics even more critical in these professions.

Another key element of the MS in Business Analytics is access to career placement services. As a first step, students complete a required Professional Development and Leadership course and have access to dedicated career services.

“The MS in Business Analytics combines classroom instruction by distinguished Columbia professors with the experience of working on real-world problems via the capstone project course,” said Iyengar. “We expect this program to have 100 percent placement of its graduates as do our very successful MS in Management Science and Engineering and MS in Financial Engineering programs.”

Applications are now being accepted for the first cohort, which will start in September 2018. Students have the option of taking a summer semester and completing the Master’s degree in one year, or can choose to take three non-contiguous semesters \(fall, spring, fall\).

## Admissions

The Master of Science program in Business Analytics \(MSBA\), offered by the IEOR Department in partnership with Columbia Business School, is the newest program between Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and Columbia Business School. It reflects the next logical step in the long standing close collaboration between the IEOR Department at the Engineering School, the Decision, Risk and Operations \(DRO\) and the Marketing Divisions at the Business School.

This program was formed and structured following many interactions with corporations, alumni and students. It emphasizes on developing new insights and understanding of business performance using data, statistical and quantitative analysis, and explanatory and predictive modeling to help make actionable decisions and to improve business operations. Students pursuing this degree program are provided with a rigorous exposure to optimization and stochastic modeling, and a deep coverage of applications in the areas of analytics. The role of analytics has grown increasingly critical in business, healthcare, government, and many other sectors of the economy.  

It is a 36-credit degree STEM-designated program \(equivalent of 12 three-credit courses\), assuming adequate preparation in probability and statistics, with students taking at least six courses within the IEOR department, four to six at the Business School. The remaining courses, if any, can be taken from the School of Engineering, the School of International and Public Affairs, the Law School, or the Departments of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics.

Graduates from this program are expected to assume positions as data analysts and data scientists, business analysts in logistics, supply chain, operations, or revenue management departments of large corporations, and as financial analysts in various functions \(e.g. risk management\) of investment banks, hedge funds, credit-card companies, and insurance.

## [Curriculum](https://msba.engineering.columbia.edu/content/curriculum)

The MSBA program is a three-semester program which can be completed in a single calendar year. Students enter in the Fall term and can finish as soon as the following August, or engage in a summer internship to complete the program by the end of the following Fall.  Students are required to take the equivalent of 12 three-credit courses \(36 credits\), in the following areas:

*  at least 6 courses \(18 credits\) within Columbia Engineering, IEOR Department  
*  4 to 6 courses \(12-18 credits\) within the Columbia Business School  
*  and the remaining courses \(if any\) can be taken from Columbia’s other graduate schools including: the School of International and Public Affairs, the Law School, or Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

A program plan will be available for students to use to plan their studies. This program plan will be used to facilitate a dialogue with your designated faculty advisor.
