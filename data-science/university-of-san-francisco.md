## Major in Data Science

The core of the Data Science major is focused around training in mathematics and computer science with 56 units distributed among these two departments. This core represents the backbone of the training that will uniquely prepare a student with an impressive array of mathematical, statistical and computational skills.

### Program Learning Outcomes

Students will:

* think logically and analyze information critically in a mathematical setting
* reformulate and solve problems in an abstract framework
* express mathematical results verbally, working individually and in collaborative groups
* apply mathematical techniques to specific problem domains
* demonstrate competence with programming concepts, including software development techniques and data structures
* apply mathematical and computational techniques to real-world problems involving large, complex data sets
* visualize, present and communicate analytical results

### Requirements

56 units

Students who for academic reasons are not eligible to major in Computer Science are also not eligible to major in Data Science due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program.
