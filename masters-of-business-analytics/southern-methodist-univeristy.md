In the past, companies have focused on reporting, data management and business intelligence. **Business Analytics** goes beyond the traditional data, BI and reporting environments and focuses on how to better analyze your business using information to gain insight to the business. It extends data management and business intelligence \(data warehousing\) to enable the management of big data, and combines it with data analytics and business information to analyze consumer behavior, web site data, marketing data and even to perform predictive analytics. The broad and intensive curriculum across a range of management disciplines and functions explores the latest methods of translating data into relevant information for decision-makers.

With big data, firms can react in real-time to customize product and service offerings, if they have the **highly specialized talent** trained to leverage this increased complexity. **SMU Cox** recognized this high-growth and high-reward career path when we developed the MSBA program for those interested in solving today’s business challenges using big data. In fact, **85% of the positions in the field of business analytics require an advanced degree**, with 75 percent listing an MS degree as an educational requirement for a career in the field. Graduates of the Cox MSBA program will be well poised to take advantage of these increasing opportunities.

Learning will take place through lecture and considerable hands-on engagement with these tools. Topics include Data Warehouse, ETL, Advanced SQL, and etc.

  **Consumer Behavior** \(2 credits\) This course is the study of why people buy what they buy. It includes an in-depth examination of the consumer decision-making processes and the factors that influence those processes. We closely look at how people make product-related decisions and the information used to make those decisions. The course is taught from a consumer-psychology perspective and shows how that perspective can be applied to business.

  **Customer Insights and Market Intelligence** \(2 credits\) This course demonstrates how firms can use primary and secondary data to gain insights about the product market and its customers and competitors. Such insights form the basis of making sound marketing decisions related to product, price, place and promotions. Emphasis is laced on quantitative and qualitative analytical approaches to inferring insights. Topics include marketing metrics; market dynamics analysis; and gaining insights from attitudinal, behavioral, and online data.

  **Data-Driven Marketing** \(2 credits\) In this course, students will be taught a variety of models that are commonly used in marketing analysis. Students will learn how to target customers using logistic regression, segment customers with cluster analysis, and develop perceptual maps using factor analysis. In addition to learning traditional marketing analysis techniques, this course reviews collaborative filtering, linear discriminant analysis, topic modeling, and principal components analysis, among others. The emphasis on this course is on using sophisticated methods to make better marketing decisions. All data analysis and visualizations will be done in R.

  **Forecasting and Predictive Analytics** \(2 credits\) This course provides an introduction to a variety of common statistical techniques for predictive analytics and forecasting. The key topics that we will cover include qualitative techniques, smoothing and decomposition of time series, regressions, the Box-Jenkins Methodology. We will emphasize on hands-on applications using a statistical package JMP, rather than technical foundations and derivations. We will also critically study these techniques, examining both their usefulness and limitations. Through this course you will learn to model uncertain business outcome, so that you can more effectively manage such uncertainty.

  **Managerial Decision Making** \(2 credits\) The purpose of this course is to help you become a better decision maker. More than anything else, what managers, analysts, and consultants do is make decisions. We will discover a series of mistakes that typical businesspeople, including you, make in a variety of managerial decision contexts, including hiring decisions, investment decisions, purchase decisions, and strategic decisions. We will do so using insights from behavioral sciences \(such as psychology, behavioral economics, consumer and organizational behavior\). At the same time, we will explore how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of relying on mathematic models or academic theories, the class is organized in a “workshop” format with a combination of case studies, discussions, student presentations, and exercises illustrating and applying the main concepts. This class will teach you the most important “soft skills” that will help you to become, and stay, a successful businessperson.

  **Managing Big Data - Managerial** \(2 credits\) This course focuses on core concepts in the adoption of Big Data technologies by modern enterprises. We'll balance lecture and discussion with some in-class lab work which will give you a foundational understanding of these technologies.

  **Operations Analytics** \(2 credits\) Organizations invest the bulk of their human and financial resources in their operations functions. In this course, students will study analytical models and techniques that can be used to improve operational and firm performance. Decision making under uncertainty will be addressed using static stochastic optimization, two-stage optimization with recourse, dynamic programming and game theory. Optimization models will be used to tackle problems in inventory management, revenue management, supply chain management, forecasting and new product development. Students will also learn how strategic decisions can be aided by data-driven, analytical models. The goal is to understand the role that analytics and analytical models can play in improving an organization’s operational processes.

  **Project Management** \(2 credits\) Managing projects in a cost effective and timely manner is one of the most challenging tasks in any organization. Competent project leadership requires understanding of how to allocate financial, material and time-based resources, and the ability to motivate and maintain focus of the project team. This course provides relevant project management skills by examining project decisions at three levels; \(i\) structuring and managing the task and leading the project team in an individual project, \(ii\) aggregate linkages across a portfolio of projects and management of programs, \(iii\) project contracting, partnering and open innovation. It introduces tools and concepts that enable project managers to evaluate, manage and execute critical functions of any project while ensuring speed, efficiency and market impact.

  **Research for Marketing Decisions** \(2 credits\) Marketing research is the formal process of gathering information needed by managers to make decisions – decisions about marketing opportunities and problems, decisions to determine and evaluate the marketing mix, and decisions based on monitoring market performance. Decisions such as: Should a new product be introduced? What are the effects of a competitor’s action? What are the most effective channels of distribution? How do marketing actions affect brand awareness or sales revenue? In this course, you will gain a solid foundation in designing and executing effective marketing research through lectures, interactive discussions and a hands-on marketing research project with a sponsoring corporation. Through the project, you will design the research, collect customer data, and analyze the data using statistical methods relevant to your research problem. In a final group presentation to company leaders, you will draw customer insights from your analysis and propose strategic and tactical recommendations for profitable growth.

  **Retailing Analytics** \(2 credits\) The vast majority of consumer expenditures, which represent more than $5 trillion dollars and 68 percent of the United States gross domestic product, are made through retailers. Moreover, the average consumer product company spends as much on trade promotions \(such as promoting its products to retailers\) as it does on media advertising and consumer promotions combined. These facts highlight the importance of retailer behavior and trade promotions in consumer marketing. This course takes the retailer’s point of view, exploring strategic and tactical decision-making by assessing the impact of these decisions on both consumer shopping behavior and the retailer’s own operating costs. Students explore issues in sales promotion, pricing, product mix, and store location in order to gain an understanding of consumer response in these areas.

  **Revenue Management** \(2 credits\) The revenue management approach is to exploit differences in customer segments and their willingness to pay. This course introduces some of the models and methods used in the developing field of revenue management \(RM\). As we develop various RM models, I will expose some new modeling techniques \(e.g., dynamic programming, heuristic approximation\) and some that you may have seen before \(linear programming, nonlinear optimization\).

  **Understanding What Customers Value** \(2 credits\) Determining what is valued is perhaps the most important issue facing marketing managers. Recently, conjoint and choice models have become popular techniques to help marketing managers understand what customers value in terms of the importance placed on specific product features and services. The objective of this course is to expose students to a variety of preference models used by brand managers and marketing analysts and to give students hands-on experience in using conjoint and choice modeling techniques. This course examines these marketing decisions using a combination of lectures, cases and exercises.

* **Beyond The Classroom**

  The best way to gain leadership experience and confidence is by connecting with people in leadership positions and immersing yourself in real world business environments. At SMU Cox, we bring opportunities for hands-on experience to life outside the classroom setting, tapping our strong ties with business leaders in Dallas and beyond.

* **Highlight: The MSBA Hands-On Intern/Capstone Project**

  Full-time MSBA students are expected to have hands-on experience with companies in the analytics area during the program. In the Spring semester, students can either work on an internship with a company from January until May in the analytics area or enroll in a semester-long Capstone project. In the Capstone project, you and a team of peers following the Process Analytics specialization will design, build and test an analytics system for a real company. By the end of the semester, you’ll have a solid grasp of the system development life cycle — plus a deeper professional network. This is a powerful way to test the academic concepts you've discussed in the classroom. And with Dallas's global business center on your doorstep, you'll find many exciting options for completing your practicum. If you do an internship, you will be expected to complete similar deliverables for course credit. International students will be able to take in internship using Curricular Practical Training \(CPT\) credits.
