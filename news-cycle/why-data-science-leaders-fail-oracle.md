> "Doing data science and managing data science are not the same."

The leader of a data science practice needs to focus on [data governance](https://www.datascience.com/blog/2018-data-science-predictions), MDM, compliance, legal issues around the use of algorithms, and documentation just in case someone sues for wrongful use. There are hiring issues and staffing problems to deal with, budget and funding to gain, P&L to run, business cases to build, market research to conduct, vendor meetings to hold, tech life-cycle management, the evangelizing of projects \(both internal and external\), and turning that work into data products that sell — all this while trying to ensure profit for the company. Big difference.

Most data scientists are just not ready to lead teams. This is why the failure rate of data science teams is so high right now. Often, companies put a strong technical person in charge when they really need a strong business person in charge. I call this person a data strategist. Right under that data strategist is the strong technical person; there needs to be a very solid and strong interpersonal relationship between the two. If they are competing, it will cause friction and less-than-desired results.  


Bad Methods

Agile has taken the tech world by storm. It works fairly well for software development and, as a result, many companies enforce it on data science. But data science is not software development — it’s really a field of discovery, whereas software development is about assembly. I have worked with companies that demand [agile and scrum](https://www.datascience.com/blog/agile-data-science) for data science and then see half their team walk in less than a year. You can’t tell a team to solve a problem in two sprints. If they don’t have the data or tools, it won’t happen.

Data science is a discipline that requires its own methods. In addition, most companies are still treating data products like they do physical products — but the economics are not the same. When I build a [recommendation engine](https://datascience.hubs.vidyard.com/watch/iK9Rsg9cfRc7Sj2tywombh), my cost per unit is pretty much zero, unlike a physical product which certainly has a per unit cost. I can make a million product recommendations with that engine or just one and, other than the electricity, my cost per recommendation would be the same. The cost of a physical product would be a lot more and involve many different variables if I wanted to increase the number from one to million.

We have to understand that the economics of data products are different. A lot of large companies don’t even have this conversation, which can cause a lot of frustration for those in charge of data products. In essence, they have one hand tied behind their back.
