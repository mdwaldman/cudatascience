[Undergraduate Degree in Statistics and Data Science](http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/statistics/)

Statistics is the science and art of prediction and explanation. The mathematical foundation of statistics lies in the theory of probability, which is applied to problems of making inferences and decisions under uncertainty. Practical statistical analysis also uses a variety of computational techniques, methods of visualizing and exploring data, methods of seeking and establishing structure and trends in data, and a mode of questioning and reasoning that quantifies uncertainty. Data science expands on statistics to encompass the entire life cycle of data, from its specification, gathering, and cleaning through its management and analysis, to its use in making decisions and setting policy. It is a natural outgrowth of statistics that incorporates advances in machine learning, data mining, and high-performance computing, along with domain expertise in the social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, management, medicine, and digital humanities.

Students majoring in Statistics and Data Science take courses in both mathematical and practical foundations. They are also encouraged to take courses in the discipline areas listed below.

The B.A. in Statistics and Data Science is designed to acquaint students with fundamental techniques in the field. The B.S. prepares students to participate in research efforts or to pursue graduate school in the study of Data Science.

**Requirements of the Statistics Major** **for** **the Class of 2019** With DUS approval, the following changes to the requirements of the major may be fulfilled by students who declared their major under previous requirements.

**Requirements of the Statistics and Data Science Major for the Class of 2020 and subsequent classes** The requirements of the new Statistics and Data Science major are indicated below.

**Courses for Nonmajors and Majors**

[S&DS 100](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20100) and [S&DS 101](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20101) through [109](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20109) only assume knowledge of high-school mathematics. Students who complete one of these courses should consider taking [S&DS 230](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20230). This sequence provides a solid foundation for the major. Other courses for non-majors include [S&DS 110](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20110) and [160](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20160).

**Prerequisites**

Multivariable calculus and linear algebra are required and should be taken before or during the sophomore year. This requirement may be satisfied by one of [MATH 120](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=MATH%20120), [ENAS 151](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=ENAS%20151), [MATH 230](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=MATH%20230), or the equivalent.

**Requirements of the Major**

Students who wish to major in Statistics and Data Science are encouraged to take [S&DS 220](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20220). But, students may also enter the major by taking a 100-level course followed by [S&DS 230](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20230). Students should complete the calculus prerequisite and linear algebra requirement as early as possible, as they provide mathematical background that is required in many courses. 

**B.A. degree program** The B.A. degree program requires eleven courses, ten of which are from the seven discipline areas described below: [MATH 222](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=MATH%20222) or [225](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=MATH%20225) from Mathematical Foundations and Theory; two courses from Core Probability and Statistics; two courses that provide Computational Skills; two courses on Methods of Data Science; and three courses from any of the discipline areas. The remaining course is fulfilled through the senior requirement.

**B.S. degree program** The B.S. degree program requires fourteen courses, including all the requirements for the B.A. degree as well as [S&DS 242](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20242), which counts as one of the required courses from Core Probability and Statistics. The two remaining courses may be chosen from Core Probability and Statistics; Computational Skills; Methods of Data Science; Mathematical Foundations and Theory; or Efficient Computation and Big Data discipline areas.

**Discipline Areas** The seven discipline areas are listed below. 

_Core Probability and Statistics_ These are essential courses in probability and statistics. Every major should take at least two of these courses, and should probably take more. Students completing the B.S. degree must take [S&DS 242](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20242). Examples of such courses include: [S&DS 238](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20238), [241](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20241), [242](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20242), [312](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20312), [351](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20351)

_Computational Skills_ Every major should be able to compute with data. While the main purpose of some of these courses is not computing, students who have taken at least two of these courses will be capable of digesting and processing data. While there are other courses that require more programming, at least two courses from the following list are essential. Examples of such courses include: [S&DS 220](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20220) or [230](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20230); [262](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20262), [425](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=S%26DS%20425), [CPSC 100](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=CPSC%20100) or [112](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=CPSC%20112), or [ENAS 130](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=ENAS%20130) \(substitution of [CPSC 201](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=CPSC%20201) or [223](http://catalog.yale.edu/search/?P=CPSC%20223) is permitted\)
