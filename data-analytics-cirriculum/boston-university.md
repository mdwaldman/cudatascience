## Master of Science in Computer Information Systems concentration in Data Analytics

![CNSS - Logo](http://www.bu.edu/met/files/2009/11/cnss-logo1.jpg)The [Master of Science in Computer Information Systems](http://www.bu.edu/met/programs/graduate/computer-information-systems/) concentration in Data Analytics will provide professionals with the skills required to compete for data analysis jobs amid rising global demand. The concentration will explore the intricacies of data analytics and expose students to various topics related to data processing, analysis, and visualization. Along with probability theory and statistical analysis methods and tools, students will learn how to generate relevant visual presentations of data and will examine concepts and techniques for data mining, text mining, and web mining. In addition to the broad background in the theory and practice of information technology gained from the Computer Information Systems core courses, individuals who complete this program will have a solid knowledge of data analytics practices accompanied by exposure to the methods and tools for data mining and knowledge discovery.

Students who complete the Computer Information Systems master’s degree concentration in Data Analytics will be able to demonstrate:

* Familiarity with applied probability and statistics, and their relevance in day-to-day data analysis
* The ability to explore the various data visualization techniques and their applications using real-world data sets
* An understanding of web analytics and metrics; how to procure and process unstructured text; and hidden patterns
* Skills in facilitating knowledge discovery using data mining techniques over vast amounts of data

A total of 40 credits is required. Students must complete both the Core Curriculum and the Concentration Requirements.
