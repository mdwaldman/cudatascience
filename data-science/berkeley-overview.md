# Berkeley Overview

## [Academic Units](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsberkeley/academic-units)

UC Berkeley is creating a dynamic new data science Division that connects academic units from across campus, including the:

[School of Information\(link is external\)](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/)

[Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences\(link is external\)](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/)

[Department of Statistics\(link is external\)](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/)

Plans are underway for a Data Science Commons that will catalyze collaboration among faculty and students from across the University to advance discovery related to the foundations, applications, and implications of data science.

In addition, data science research and education activities are underway in many other academic units across Berkeley, from the [Industrial Engineering\(link is external\)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/)[ and Operations Research\(link is external\)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) and [Physics\(link is external\)](http://physics.berkeley.edu/ABOUT-US) departments to the interdepartmental [DS421\(link is external\)](http://ds421.berkeley.edu/) Environment and Society Research Training Program.  

A diagram of the initial vision for Division's organizational structure is available [here.](https://evcp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ddsi_org_structure.pdf)
