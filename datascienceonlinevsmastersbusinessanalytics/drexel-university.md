### WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA SCIENCE AND DATA ANALYTICS?

Though many use the terms interchangeably, there is a big difference between data science and data analytics. Data analysts do what their name implies: they analyze large amounts of data to try and find patterns that can inform their organizations’ future decisions. Data scientists, on the other hand, are much more focused on technology. They design, develop and use tools to help in sifting through data, then present their findings to help their organizations make strategic decisions.
