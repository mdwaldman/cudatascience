#### Electives \(choose 3 courses\)

CS312- Object-Oriented Software Design  
CS484 - Artificial Intelligence  
CS487 - Big Data  
IS453 - Information Systems Analysis and Design  
IS460 - Data Visualization  
IS465 - Text Mining  
MA301 - Linear Algebra  
ST461 - Elements of Statistical Theory I: Distributions \(MA351 is a prerequisite\)  
ST466 - Experimental Design  
EC420 - Econometrics  
EC 425 - Applied Economic Forecasting  
Or appropriate course approved by program director \(Eg GIS\)  
  
Up to 2 graduate DS courses may be taken with approval from the graduate director  
  
An internship as DS499 may be taken for university credit, but does not count as an elective in the BS DS. It is not anticipated that this course would substitute for the capstone as the ethical component in the capstone is particularly important. This aspect would not necessarily be present in the internship. Instead it is expected that the internship experience may enhance the capstone experience for the student by providing the relationship from which the student can develop the capstone project.  
  
It is recommended that students take EC102 and EC103 for their social science core.
