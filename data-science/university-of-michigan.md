## Program Core 

 EECS 203 \(4 credits\): Discrete Mathematics. Acceptable alternative: Math 465. • 

EECS 280 \(4 credits\): Programming and Elementary Data Structures. •

 EECS 281 \(4 credits\): Data Structures and Algorithms. • 

STATS 412 \(3 credits\): Introduction to Probability and Statistics. 

•STATS 413 \(4 credits\): Applied Regression Analysis

### Every student in a Data Science program will take at least one course from each of the three following categories as part of the core requirements: o

 Machine learning and data mining elective: EECS 445 or STATS 415. Both these courses draw on techniques from statistics, computing, and linear algebra to provide a comprehensive introduction to machine learning and applications to a variety of domains. Credit is granted for only one course since the two courses have significant overlap in content. o 

Data management and applications elective: EECS 484 or EECS 485. These courses introduce the concept of databases, which are applicable to storing and querying large datasets.

  Data science applications elective \(3 credits\): A student must take at least one upper-level course related to data science applications \(e.g. computer vision, robotics, healthcare, biology, finance, chemistry, sensor-based systems, and security\). Visit the DS-Eng website for the current list of approved courses that satisfy this requirement.
