### [Master of Computational Data Science](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/)

### 

The MCDS program is designed for students with a degree in computer science, computer engineering or a related degree from a highly ranked university. After completing the common MCDS core courses in the first semester, you can pick from three concentrations: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses. The degree can also be earned two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.

Here are the options:

* Professional Preparation — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December.
* Research Preparation — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May.

Core Curriculum

All MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the following curriculum:

* 15-513 - Introduction to Computer Systems \(undergraduate prerequisite\)
* Four \(4\) MCDS Core Courses \(48 units\)
* Three courses \(3\) from one area of concentration curriculum \(36 units\)
* Two \(2\) MCDS Capstone courses \(11-634 and 11-632\) \(36 units\)
* Two \(2\) Electives: any graduate level course 600 and above in the School of Computer Science \(24 units\)

Area of Concentration

1. During the first two semesters in the program, all students take a set of four \(4\) required core courses: Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Interactive Data Science, and Data Science Seminar.
2. By the end of the first semester, all students must select at least one area of concentration — Systems, Analytics, or Human-Centered Data Science — which governs the courses taken after the first semester.
3. To maximize your chances of success in the program, you should consider which concentration area\(s\) you are best prepared for, based on your educational background, work experience, and  areas of interest as described in your Statement of Purpose.
4. You are strongly encouraged to review the detailed curriculum requirements for each concentration area, in order to determine the best fit given your preparation and background.

To earn an MCDS degree, you must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area and electives. You must also complete a capstone project in which you work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project. In total, you will complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. You must take a certain number of core courses depending on your chosen area of concentration. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the curriculum.

**Preparation Prerequisite**  
Historically, students typically need a refresher on basic computer science systems before beginning graduate work at CMU. You must earn a B- or better in the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems \(6 units\), typically in the summer before your program commences. \(This course is the distance education version of [15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/).\) Failure to pass the course means that you have to take 15-213 during either the fall semester, and the units will not count toward your 144 eligible units of study.

**Core Curriculum and Area of Concentration**  
During your first two semesters in the MCDS program, you will complete a required set of four \(4\) core courses: Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Interactive Data Science and Data Science Seminar. By the end of your first semester, you must choose at least one \(1\) area of concentration— Systems, Analytics, or Human-Centered Data Science — which governs the additional core courses you will take beyond your first semester. To maximize your chance of success in the program, you should select a concentration area for which you're well-prepared, based on educational background, work experience and the areas described in your Statement of Purpose.  You should carefully consider your choice of concentration area before you apply. You are strongly encouraged to review the detailed curriculum requirements for each area of concentration, in order to determine the best fit given your preparation and background.

**Internship**  
Every student is required to complete an industry internship or adequate practical training. This typicall happens in the summer between the first fall and spring semesters.

**Electives**  
You can take three elective courses. The electives should be any graduate-level, 12-unit course in the School of Computer Science.

**Working Directly With Faculty**  
Some students want to explore more research-oriented studies conducted directly with a faculty member. To perform this kind of work, your background and the faculty member's interest must be closely aligned. You will take an independent study course as an elective and work with the faculty member. If you're interested in this option, please contact the director.
