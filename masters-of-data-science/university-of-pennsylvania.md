## Program of Study

The ten course units for the Data Science degree are divided into three categories:

\(As long as the prerequisites for the courses are met, students can complete these courses in any sequence\) 

1.  Foundations \(two course units\)

* Programming Languages & Techniques \(PL\): Programming Languages & Techniques [\(CIT 590\) ](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit590-2016/index.html)orIntroduction to  Software Development \([CIT 591\)](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cit591/) 
* Probability: ENM 503 Intro to Probability & Statistics or STAT 510 Probability or MATH 546

If students have taken these courses as part of another program, this may be waived.

For submatriculants, the probability requirement may be waived with successful completion of ESE 301 or STAT 430; the programming requirement can be waived with successful completion of CIS 120. A student may also waive the requirement with any other relevant course after getting department approval.  

_Please understand that CIS 120/ESE 301/any other relevant undergraduate course can only be used to waive these requirements and **CAN NOT** be used as courses to count towards the masterâ€™s degree. Upon waiving these requirements, students must take Technical Electives or a course of their choice \(subject to department approval\) in lieu of them._

2. Core Requirements \(three course units\)

* Mathematical Foundations: Mathematical Statistics [\(STAT 512\)](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~mbaiocch/Stat512.html) or[ ](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis515/)Linear Algebra/Optimization [\(CIS 515\)](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis515/)  or Computational Learning Theory [\(CIS 625](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/COLT/)\)
* Big Data Analytics: Big Data Analytics \([CIS 545\)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis545/)
* Mining and Learning: Intro to Machine Learning \([CIS 519\)](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/fall2017/) or Machine Learning \([CIS 520\)](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~cis520/wiki/) or Modern Data Mining \([STAT 571\)](https://syllabi-media.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/2017C-STAT471402-47c60331.pdf)

3. Technical & Depth Area Electives \(five course units\)

**Students must choose courses from 3 different buckets, one bucket of which can be a 2 semester sequence of thesis/practicum. Two of the courses must represent a depth sequence, which could be the thesis/practicum or \(for bucket options B-J\) two courses, one of which builds on the other \(e.g. is a prerequisite\).**  


### BUCKETS for Technical & Depth Area Electives

#### Applications

**A. TitleThesis/Practicum \(two course units\)**

**B. Bio medicine**

**C. Social/Network Science**

**D. Natural Science/Engineering**

#### Methods

**E. Data-centric Programming**

**F. Data Collection, Representation, Management and Retrieval**

**G. Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence**

**H. Simulation Methods for Natural Science/Engineering**

**I. Modelling**

**J. Statistics, Mathematical Foundations**
