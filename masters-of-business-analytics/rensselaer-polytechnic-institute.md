  ITWS 6600 Data Analytics

  The world at-large is confronted with increasingly larger and complex sets of

  structured/unstructured information; from cyber and human sources. Traditional

  enterprises are moving toward analytics-driven approaches for core business functions.

  Data and information analytics extends analysis \(descriptive models of data\) by using

  data mining and machine learning methods, with optimization and validation, to

  recommend action or guide and communicate decision-making. Thus, analytics is an

  entire methodology rather then individual analyses or analysis steps.

  problems. Students will conduct a semester long, team based, hands-on data analytics

  project. A data set will be selected at the start of the semester from a collection of

  projects supplied by on- and/or off-campus clients. The client will provide project and

  data set background and assist in objective setting. Alternatively, a student and/or team

  may bring a data set and problem with them. This is expected to be useful for graduate

  students with their advisor and/or research collaborators being the clients. Students will

  actively engage in the process of transforming knowledge to data, gaining experience

  applying data analytic methods learned in prior courses. Students will also be

  instructed in the process of project objective setting, planning, and management. They

  will conduct their project based on goals agreed upon with the project client, and a

  workflow they develop to attain these goals. Students will be guided via classroom

  demonstrations and individualized team coaching by the instructors in the employment

  of visualization, analytics and modeling methods. The demonstrations will be done in

  the R data analytics environment and will involve the use of R routines, external

  packages, script building and the use of pre-built scripts provided by the instructors. An

  R ‘boot camp’ will be held at the beginning of the semester to get those unfamiliar with

  MGMT 6962 Marketing Analytics

  With the development of technology, the amount of available information that can help

  organizations make decisions grows exponentially over the past decades. These

  information could be structured data such as online transaction data or highly

  unstructured data such as blogs, tweets and video clips. With the abundant data, firms

  can extract customer purchasing pattern, identify potential market and forecast sales

  trends, gain competitive advantage and create substantial value for the company. This

  class introduces some fundamental statistical models which are very effective in

  explaining and predicting marketing patterns using new forms of information emerging

  from the technology advances. These models can significantly improve the decisions by

  practitioners as they also offer intuitively sounds descriptions on various observed data

  patterns. Meanwhile, as more and more firms adopt sophisticated toolkit to conduct

  business analysis \(Excel toolkit, SPSS and etc.\), understanding these statistical models

  can become an essential part of regular business. The contents we covered in this

  course will be helpful for managers to get the greatest business value in today’s data

  intensive business environment. We will also apply these statistical models to real

  marketing problems using real marketing data. Students are expected to finish a final

  project by applying techniques covered in this class on a real world dataset. This is

  because the core of developing the quantitative skills in this class is through hands-on

  exercises. This project is designed to enhance students’ understanding of the concepts

  introduced in this class, and to allow students to have the opportunity to absorb the skills

  rather than just get exposed to them.
