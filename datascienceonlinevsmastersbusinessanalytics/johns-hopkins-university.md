* your prior education must include the following prerequisites: \(1\) multivariate calculus; \(2\) discrete mathematics; \(3\) courses in Java or C++ \(note that actual competency in Java is expected and that Python can be accepted on a case-by-case basis\); and \(4\) a course in data structures. Linear Algebra or Differential Equations will be accepted in lieu of Discrete Mathematics. A grade of Bâˆ’ or better must have been earned in each of the prerequisite courses.
* Please refer to the [course schedule](http://apps.ep.jhu.edu/schedule/search?program=Data%20Science) published each term for exact dates, times, locations, fees, and instructors.
