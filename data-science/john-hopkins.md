# John Hopkins





[Master of Science in Data Science](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/data-science)

#### Master's Degree

**Admission Requirements**

* You must meet the [general admission requirements](https://ep.jhu.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/admissions/admission-requirements) that pertain to all master's degree candidates.
* your prior education must include the following prerequisites: \(1\) multivariate calculus; \(2\) discrete mathematics; \(3\) courses in Java or C++ \(note that actual competency in Java is expected and that Python can be accepted on a case-by-case basis\); and \(4\) a course in data structures. Linear Algebra or Differential Equations will be accepted in lieu of Discrete Mathematics. A grade of B− or better must have been earned in each of the prerequisite courses.
* If your prior education does not include the prerequisites listed above, you may still be admitted under provisional status, followed by full admission once you have completed the missing prerequisites. Missing prerequisites may be completed with Johns Hopkins Engineering \(all prerequisites beyond calculus are available\) or at another regionally accredited institution.
* You may submit a detailed résumé if you would like your academic and professional background to be considered.
* If you are an [international student](https://ep.jhu.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/admissions/international-students), you may have additional admission requirements.

**Degree Requirements**

* A total of ten courses must be completed within five years.
* The curriculum consists of eight required courses and two 700-level electives - one from the Applied and Computational Mathematics \(625.7xx\) program and one from the Computer Science program \(605.7xx\).
* Courses applied toward undergraduate or graduate degrees at other institutions \(non-JHU\) are not eligible for transfer or double counting to a Data Science master's degree or post-master's certificate. Up to two graduate courses taken outside of JHU after an undergraduate degree was conferred and not applied toward a graduate or other degree may be considered toward the Data Science master's degree subject to advisor approval.
* Graduate students who are not pursuing a master's degree in Data Science should consult with their advisor to determine which courses must be successfully completed before 600- or 700-level Data Science courses may be taken.
* Only one C-range grade \(C+, C, or C−\) can count toward the master’s degree.
* All course selections are subject to advisor approval.

#### Post Master's Certificate

**Admission Requirements**

* You must meet the [general admission requirements](https://ep.jhu.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/admissions/admission-requirements) that pertain to all post master's certificate candidates. Coursework should have included coursework comparable to at least three of the four required courses in both the Computer Science area and the Applied and Computational Mathematics area, respectively.
* Applicants with a master's degree in data science or a very closely related field, such as applied statistics, are eligible to apply.

**Certificate Requirements**

* A total of six courses must be completed within three years.
* You must select at least three courses from the Applied and Computational Mathematics program \(625.xxx\) and at least three courses from the Computer Science program \(605.xxx\).
* At least four of the courses must be 700-level with at least two from Computer Science and at least two from Applied and Computational Mathematics.
* 625.603 Statistical Methods and Data Analysis may not be applied to the post-master's certificate.
* One graduate course taken outside of JHU and not applied toward a graduate or other degree may be considered toward the Data Science Post-Master’s Certificate, subject to advisor approval.
* Only grades of B− or above can be counted toward the post-master’s certificate.
* All course selections are subject to advisor approval.
