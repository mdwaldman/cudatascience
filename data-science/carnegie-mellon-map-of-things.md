### PREREQUISITE COURSEWORK INFORMATION

**You may want to consider enrolling in prerequisite coursework prior to applying for admission.**Taking an object-oriented and/or probability/statistics course is a great way to show the Admissions Committee that you are proactively preparing for graduate school and **fulfilling the prerequisites for enrollment**.

Heinz College neither prefers nor recommends any specific institutions at which you should complete your prerequisite coursework. Courses offered through _Coursera_ or other MOOC platforms _do not_meet the prerequisite coursework requirements for admission to Heinz College.

Our faculty and staff are here to help you review courses you are considering. If you have any questions regarding admission and enrollment prerequisites, please contact the Office of Admissions via email at [hnzadmit@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:hnzadmit@andrew.cmu.edu), or give us a call at 412-268-2164.

* [Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/admissions/information-systems-management/#)

  To ensure this requirement is met by each enrolling student, the Admissions Committee will look for proof of each applicant's applied technical background/experience listed on the transcript\(s\) and résumé submitted to the Office of Admissions. Specific examples of applied skills include:

  * independently write programs in approved languages \(Java, C++\)
  * compile, de-bug and execute programs

  If the committee determines that an applicant's hands-on technical background does not meet the faculty's requirement for the MISM program, the student may be required to complete an object-oriented programming course prior to enrollment in the program. This condition will be included in the offer of admission and will require that you take a pre-approved course at an accredited university and achieve a grade of B or better in the course. Students offered admission with the condition of successfully completing an object-oriented programming course prior to enrollment should contact the Office of Admissions to verify that the course you have selected meets the faculty's standards.

   Please note the following:

  * Java is the preferred programming language \(other programming language accepted is C++\)
  * Must be a college-/ university-level course at an accredited institution
  * Must be for credit and a grade
  * The course may be taken on-campus or online 

  Courses that do not grant credit and a grade will not fulfill this requirement, even if you receive a certificate of completion for the course.

   If you are prospective student who wishes to complete the prerequisite programming courses for admission to Heinz College, **please consider the following** **"Pre-Approved Java Programming Courses" as you look for suitable classes**.

* [Pre-Approved Java Programming Courses](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/admissions/information-systems-management/#)

  **UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO EXTENSION**

  At UC San Diego Extension, the following two classes have been pre-approved as prerequisite programming courses for admission to Heinz College:

  [Java Programming I: Fundamental Java Concepts \(Course \# CSE-40479\)](http://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/java-programming-i-fundamental-java-concepts)

  Note that this class lists a prerequisite course, but some students have been successful without the formal prerequisite course if they have previously studied programming on their own.

  [Java Programming II: Core Java Programming \(Course \# CSE-40480\)](http://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/java-programming-ii-core-java-programming)

  We prefer that you take this class, because it covers “exceptions handling," and it also covers deeper-level topics that will better prepare you for the MISM program. UCSD Extension CSE-40479 \(or similar experience\) is listed as a prerequisite for this class.

  **UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY EXTENSION**

  At UC Berkeley Extension, the following class has been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:

  [Java: Discovering Its Power \(Course \# EL ENG X436.2\)](http://extension.berkeley.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=40962)

  Note that prerequisite courses are listed for this class, but some students have been successful without the formal prerequisite courses if they previously studied Java \(or C++\) on their own. \(C++ is similar to Java.\)

  **UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA CRUZ EXTENSION**

  At UCSC Extension, the following class has been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:

  [Java Programming for Beginners \(Course \# CMPR.X412\)](http://course.ucsc-extension.edu/modules/shop/index.html?action=courseBrowse&CatalogID=80)

  Note that no prerequisite is listed. Search the page for the course number \(CMPR.X412\) and click on the course number to view all upcoming sections.

  **BOSTON UNIVERSITY**

  At Boston University, the following class has been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:

  [MET CS 520 Information Structures with Java](http://www.bu.edu/csmet/academic-programs/mscisonline/onlineschedule/)

  Note that this class has a prerequisite, which MUST be waived per the instructor’s consent. In order to waive the prerequisite, please email the instructor who is teaching the course that semester \(BU provides you that email address\) with any previous technology or programming skills. If the professor grants you a waiver, please forward that waiver to [METCSAPP@bu.edu](mailto:METCSAPP@bu.edu). The team at BU will manually register you as a non-degree seeking student.

  **Please note:** Because of the prerequisite requirement, you _cannot_ register for this course online. It must be registered for manually after gaining the prerequisite waiver.

  **HARVARD EXTENSION SCHOOL**

  At Harvard Extension School, the following two classes have been pre-approved as prerequisite programming courses for admission to Heinz College. Note that Java I is a prerequisite to Java II and is intended for students with no previous programming background.

  [CSCI E-10A Introduction to Computer Science Using Java I](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-computer-science-using-java-i/14289?_ga=1.215333909.387231760.1479505470)

  Note that this class is generally offered during the Fall Semester.

  [CSCI E-10B Introduction to Computer Science Using Java II](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-computer-science-using-java-ii/24027)

  Note that this class is generally offered during the Spring Semester. This course lists a prerequisite, but some students have been successful without the formal prerequisite course if they possess the equivalent experience in a high-level programming language such as C, C++, or Java.

  **PARKLAND COLLEGE**

  At Parkland College, the following class has been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:

  [CSC 140 Computer Science I \(Java\)](http://online.parkland.edu/)

* [Probability/Statistics](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/admissions/information-systems-management/#)

  **All enrolling students in the MISM-BIDA track must meet the basic statistics coursework requirement by completing a college-level statistics course with a grade of B or higher.**When choosing an appropriate college-level course to take, you may choose a course designed for students with very little or no background in statistics. Course topics should include probability and probability tables, conditional probability, Bayes' Rule, random variables and expected value, and the basics of normal distribution and hypothesis testing. At the conclusion of the course, students should have the basic tools for analyzing data and outcomes involving probabilistic circumstances.

* [Database](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/admissions/information-systems-management/#)

  All enrolling students in the MISM-BIDA track must meet the basic database coursework requirement by completing a college-level database course with a grade of B or higher. The course should cover relational database design and an introduction to database programming.

  The classes below have been pre-approved by the faculty to satisfy the Database prerequisite for enrollment.
