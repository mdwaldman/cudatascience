### [Specialization in Statistics and Data Science](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/academics/professional-masters-program/specialization-statistics-and-data-science)

### Specialization in Statistics and Data Science

Students will have the option to specialize in Statistics and Data Science. This specialization is meant to give students the foundational tools for analyzing data, including complex and high dimensional datasets. There are four required courses and many electives coming from two categories:

* Probability and Statistics Theory: Courses in this category introduce the theory of probability and stochastic processes, and the foundations of statistical inference. \(Courses: STAT 5520 Introduction to Mathematical Statistics \(**required**\); STAT 5100 Markov Processes, Queues, and Monte Carlo Simulations; STAT 5540 Times Series; APPM 6520 Mathematics Statistics\)
* Statistical Modeling and Data Science: Courses in this category provide students with the tools to model and analyze data, perform predictive analyses, and apply theory to solve important scientific problems.  \(Courses: STAT 5000: Statistical Methods and Applications I \(**required**\);  STAT 5010: Statistical Methods and Applications II \(**required**\); STAT 5400 Advanced Statistical Modeling \(**required**\); STAT 5610 Statistical Learning \(**required**\); STAT 5430 Spatial Statistics; STAT 5630 Computational Bayesian Statistics\)

Students interested in statistics and data science are encouraged to complete their CE project through the departmentâ€™s [Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/lisa/) \(LISA\). The most natural way to do this would be to produce a written report and presentation of a collaborative project from STAT 5680 Statistical Collaboration or STAT 5690 Advanced Statistical Collaboration. Students who do not take both STAT 5680 and STAT 5690 will have a deficit of 3 credit hours; such deficits can be filled in by elective coursework as determined with the faculty advisor to reach the 30 credit hours required for the degree.  This option will not require a final examination with committee.

**Table 1** provides a list of the probability and statistics courses available to count for the statistics and data science specialization. Additional courses may count for this track but must be approved by the director.

**Customized Specialization**

Students are able to build a customized specialization based on their own interests. Such specializations should be designed with the professional MS director within the first year of the program.
