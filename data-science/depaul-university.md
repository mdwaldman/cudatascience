### Degree Requirements

Students in this degree program must meet the following requirements:   


* Complete a minimum of 52 graduate credit hours in addition to any required introductory courses of the designated degree program.
* Complete all graduate courses and requirements listed in the designated degree program.
* Earn a grade of C- or better in all courses of the designated program.
* Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher.
* Students pursuing a second \(or more\) graduate degree may not double count or retake any course that applied toward the completion of a prior graduate degree. If a required course in the second degree was already completed and applied toward a previous degree, the student must meet with a faculty advisor to discuss a new course to be completed and substituted in the new degree. This rule also applies to cross-listed courses, which are considered to be the same course but offered under different subjects.
* Students pursuing a second master's degree must complete a minimum of 52 graduate credit hours beyond their first designated degree program in addition to any required introductory courses in their second designated degree program. 

Students with a GPA of 3.9 or higher will graduate with distinction.

For DePaul's policy on repeat graduate courses and a complete list of academic policies see the [DePaul Graduate Handbook in the Course Catalog](http://sr.depaul.edu/CourseCatalog/CurrentCourseCatalog/index.asp).
