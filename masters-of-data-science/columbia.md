#### Topics in Computer Science: Causal Inference for Data Science

Instructor Adam Kelleher [\(Syllabus\)](http://datascience.columbia.edu/files/seasdepts/idse/pdf-files/9_-_COMS_W4995.005_Causal_Inference_Syllabus.pdf)Data scientists often have to answer questions that will lead to decisions about actions a company might take. Often, they will be able to run an experiment, and see the effect the decision might have by testing it first.  Other times, they will only have observational data at their disposal. In both cases, they need to infer the causal effect of an action on some outcomes of interest. Causal inference is an essential skill for a data scientist. Without a proper understanding, potential biases as large as 1000% have been observed in practice! This course will cover the basics of the potential outcomes framework, the Pearlian framework, and a collection of methods for observational and experimental causal inference. We'll use examples from industry applications throughout the course, especially focused on web applications.

#### Topics in Information Processing: Big Data Analytics

[Professor Ching-Yung Lin](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ching-yung-lin) \([Syllabus](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~cylin/course/bigdata/)\)

**Prerequisites: one or more programming languages: C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, and/or Javascript.**

With the advance of IT storage, processing, computation, and sensing technologies, Big Data has become a novel norm of life. Only until recently, computers are able to capture and analysis all sorts of large-scale data from all kinds of fields -- people, behavior, information, devices, sensors, biological signals, finance, vehicles, astronology, neurology, etc. Almost all industries are bracing into the challenge of Big Data and want to dig out valuable information to get insight to solve their challenges. This course shall provide the fundamental knowledge to equip students being able to handle those challenges. This discipline inherently involves many fields. Because of its importance and broad impact, new software and hardware tools and algorithms are quickly emerging. A data scientist needs to keep up with this ever changing trends to be able to create a state-of-the-art solution for real-world challenges.

#### Topics in Quantitative Finance: Big Data in Finance

Professor Miquel Noguer Alonso \([Syllabus](http://datascience.columbia.edu/files/seasdepts/idse/pdf-files/Big_Data_in_Finance_Syllabus_2017.pdf)\)

The vast proliferation of data and increasing technological complexities continue to transform the way industries operate and compete. Over the last two years, 90 percent of the data in the world has been created as a result of the creation of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data on a daily basis. Commonly referred to as big data, this rapid growth and storage creates opportunities for collection, processing and analysis of structured and unstructured data. Financial services, in particular, have widely adopted big data analytics to inform better investment decisions with consistent returns. In conjunction with big data, algorithmic trading uses vast historical data with complex mathematical models to maximize portfolio returns. The continued adoption of big data will inevitably transform the landscape of financial services. However, along with its apparent benefits, significant challenges remain in regards to big data‚Äôs ability to capture the mounting volume of data. The increasing volume of market data poses a big challenge for financial institutions. Along with vast historical data, banking and capital markets need to actively manage ticker data. Likewise, investment banks and asset management firms use voluminous data to make sound investment decisions. Insurance and retirement firms can access past policy and claims information for active risk management. The course will be a mix of Theory and practice with real big data cases in finance. We will invite guest lecturers mostly for real Big Data Finance Applications. We will give MATLAB, R or Python examples.

STATS GR5293, Sec 002

#### Topics in Modern Statistics: Applied Machine Learning for Financial Modeling and Forecasting

Instructor: Michel Leonard

The course focuses on translating technical expertise into work-place solutions by teaching students to: \(1\) identify relevant shortfalls in  traditional processes; \(2\) precisely match datasets and machine learning features to overcome these shortfalls; \(3\) narrowly define value to fit work place processes, analytical framework, and bottom line.  Each class will be structured as an actual end-to-end work-place project and use concrete examples to teach students to design, build and deliver solutions  that integrate these considerations. A combination of assignments, presentation, and research paper will be sued to evaluation students' progress in bridging technical and applied solutions with evaluation criteria matching those of a work-place project.

STATS GR5293, Sec 003

[Professor Gregory Falco](https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty/gregory-falco) \([Syllabus](http://sustainability.ei.columbia.edu/files/2015/02/SUMA-K4360-Sustainability-Technology-and-the-Evolution-of-Smart-Cities-Website.pdf)\)

This course is offered through the School of Continuing Education. The progress of sustainability in recent years has almost entirely been a result in the evolution of smart, sustainable technology solutions. This course examines opportunities to drive sustainability through technology applications with the end goal of piecing together all of the pieces to envision an intelligent city. Companies are increasingly turning to technology to fulfill their sustainability goals considering many technologies provide off-the-shelf, cost-effective and immediate savings compared to operationally invasive, resource-heavy sustainability transformation programs. Sustainability technology ranges from intelligent infrastructure to mobile applications that help to drive the "sharing economy". The course will provide an overview of the sustainability technologies that large corporations are actively pursuing and delve into the project management and integration strategies required to implement these solutions. Successful sustainability practitioners must not only have a strong understanding of the values and methodologies of sustainable operations, but also the tools and technologies available to drive sustainability throughout their organization. Upon completion of the class, students will have a sufficient level of understanding to discuss these solutions and relevant case studies with potential employers. This course will benefit anyone interested in a career in sustainability or in smart cities as it will provide them the skills and analytical capabilities to analyze which sustainability technologies are a good fit for their company's sustainability and growth strategy.
