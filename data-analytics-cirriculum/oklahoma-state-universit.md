Merger of MS in MIS with Data Science option, MS in Business Analytics

The Spears School of Business developed and offered one of the first analytics programs in the nation, with two distinct tracks built on our strengths and diversity of talents. Over time, Spears Business has developed strong relationships with major analytics providers such as SAS, Teradata, IBM, and others.

As the needs of business have evolved, along with the integration of different commercial and open source software as a common toolset for analytics/data science professionals, OSU, in response, has now opted to create one common program \(pending internal approvals\). This program will include an integrated core set of data science experiences, while allowing the students to specialize in areas such as marketing analytics, health analytics, among others.

“This is an exciting development and represents OSU’s and the Spears School’s commitment to providing a world-class interdisciplinary, value-added analytics/data science program staffed by award winning instructors and internationally known experts in the field,” said Rick Wilson, head of the Department of Management Science and Information Systems.

“I am delighted to see this merger happen,” said Goutam Chakraborty, director of the Master’s in Business Analytics program. “This merger will allow us to provide a high-class, high-touch, comprehensive master’s program for graduate students in the Spears School of Business.”

The Master of Science in Business Analytics \(MSBAN\) is a comprehensive inter-disciplinary program in business data analytics conducted in a multi-platform environment that includes  **SAS®**, **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **Tableau**, etc. Additionally, the program places a strong emphasis on soft skills and business acumen development.

“MSBAN curriculum is designed to produce the best in class **advanced analytics** and marketing **data science** professionals by focusing on holistic development of each candidate. In addition to classes, students are provided numerous free trainings beyond their coursework in many advanced analytics topics as well as soft skills. This is the place where students **work hard and play hard** to achieve their dreams,” according to Dr. Goutam Chakraborty, Director of MSBAN program.
