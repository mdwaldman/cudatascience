#### Depth, Breadth, and Context

The new major focuses on three dimensions that leverage the University’s strengths:

* computational, statistical, and mathematical depth, including a core set of data science courses built from the ground up;
* breadth, as reflected in the requirement for a “[domain emphasis](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis),” or specialization in one of an array of subject areas, including Evolution and Biodiversity, Inequalities and Society, and Organizations and the Economy; and
* societal awareness, or an understanding of the social and human contexts in which data are applied, and of related concerns such as privacy, governance, and the impacts on human beings living in a data-abundant society.
