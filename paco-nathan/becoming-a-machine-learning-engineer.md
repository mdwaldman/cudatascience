### Business metrics are distinct from machine learning metrics

> You can spend months tuning a great classifier that will detect with 98% precision a particular set of topics, but then you launch it and it really doesn't affect your business metrics whatsoever.
>
> The first step is to really understand what the business metrics, or objectives, are. How are you going to measure them? Then, go and see if you have a chance at improving things. An interesting technique is to try to manually achieve the task. Have a human try to achieve the task and see if that has an impact. It's not always possible, but if you can do that, it might be worth spending months building an architecture to do it automatically. If a human cannot improve things, it might be challenging for a machine to do better. It might still be possible, but it might be tougher.
>
> Make sure you know what the business objective is and never to lose track of it. I've seen people start improving models, but they don't really have metrics to see whether or not things have improved. It sounds stupid but one of the very first things you need to do is to make sure you have clear metrics that everybody agrees on. It's very tempting to say, ‘I feel this architecture is going to work better’ and try to then work on it, but it hasn't improved anything because you're working without metrics.
