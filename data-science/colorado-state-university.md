# Colorado State University

[Data Science Major](https://www.natsci.colostate.edu/data-science/)

In this major, you will use technical skills, theory, and creativity to tackle large and complex data sets to solve real-world problems. You will take a core of data science, computer science, mathematics, and statistics classes and then pick a concentration in computer science, economics, mathematics, or statistics. All concentrations come together to complete a team capstone project.
