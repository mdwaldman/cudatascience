**STA S380.17: Statistics I: Intro to Predictive Modeling**

This course will involve the study of a variety of techniques for predictive analytics. Particular emphasis will be given to approaches that are scalable to very large data sets and/or those that are relatively robust when faced with a large number of predictors, and algorithms for heterogeneous or streaming data. Many of these capabilities are essential for handing BIG DATA. Connections to relevant business problems shall be made via example studies. We will mostly be using Python \(specially Scikit-Learn\). The central goal of this course is to convey an understanding of the pros and cons of different predictive modeling techniques, so that you can \(i\) make an informed decision on what approaches to consider when faced with real-life problems requiring predictive modeling, \(ii\) apply models properly on real datasets so to make valid conclusions. This goal will be reinforced through both theory and hands-on experience.

**MIS S381N: Data Analytics Programming**

Data-driven analysis has wrought a quiet revolution in business. As disk storage and computing power have become cheaper, companies have started maintaining detailed logs of inventories, sales, and customer activity, among others. Yet, this is only half the job; the real need is for insights, and this course teaches you the tools for that. This course uses Python & Pandas.

**MIS 382NN: Advanced Predictive Modeling**

This course will involve the study of a variety of techniques for predictive analytics.

**BA 385T: Financial Management**

Recent advances in cost accounting, inputs into the design of cost systems, maximizing shareholder value through the investment decision and the financing decision; time value of money to value projects, bonds, stocks, and an entire firm.

**OM 380: Supply Chain Analytics**

Supply Chain Management \(SCM\) is the management of activities governing the flow and transformation of resources from initial suppliers to ultimate consumers to make goods and services available at the right time, place, price, and condition in the most profitable and cost effective manner. In this course, we will consider analytics applied to important problems found in the management of supply chains. The first half of the course introduces the context for application of analytics in operations. The second half of the course addresses use of analytics in supply chain management.

**MKT 382: Marketing Analytics I**

Introduction to marketing strategy; topics include company, customer, competitive analysis, segmentation, targeting and positioning, the marketing mix and mix response analysis.

**MIS 284N: Text Analysis**

This course is designed to introduce the basics of text mining and text based predictions of business outcomes. The contents of this course will serve as a foundation of subsequent courses such as Social Media Analytics. The pedagogical structure of the course will consist of classroom lectures, use of tools such as Python scripts and packages like SentiStrength \(for sentiment analysis\), and group assignments involving the categorization and classification of a variety of documents as well as the application of text analytics in solving business problems.

**RM 194: Decision Analysis**

This course is an introduction to quantitative decision making. Quantitative decision making adds value to data by using it to build models that can help in the decision making process. We will cover decision analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. This will be followed by a second course in the spring on mathematical programming including linear programming, non-linear programming and integer programming. The focus in both courses will be on model formulation and intuition behind the solution techniques rather than the mathematical theory. Formal math skills like calculus, linear algebra, and probability/statistics will be used some but not much. You do need the ability to think logically and systematically, but improving this ability is a course goal. The course will also introduce students to some advanced commercial software that supports the development of these models.

**MIS 381N: Introduction to Database Management**
