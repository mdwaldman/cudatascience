CAPSTONE/EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING



Business Statistics Professor: Steve Stuk

This course is a refresher and a new look at how statistical methods begin the process of understanding and describing data.  
We will use r/rstudio to review basic data exploration and statistical methods. The course will be very hands on and practical, working with real world data.  
though hypothesis testing and modeling. The tools and techniques in the class will be fundamental to all following classes.

Introduction to data analytics Professor: Vilma Todri

In this class, we will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining in order to extract useful information and knowledge from data. We will improve our ability to approach problems "data-analytically", we will examine real-world examples that place data mining in context, and we will apply data-mining techniques while working hands-on with data mining projects. In particular, the course will provide an understanding of the general framework for building and evaluating predictive models, both for classification and numeric prediction data mining tasks. The course will cover supervised predictive modeling techniques, such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes classifiers, and logistic regression as well as unsupervised predictive modeling techniques, such as clustering and association rule mining.

Advanced Data Science/Machine Learning I Professor: George Easton

This course will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning. Both supervised and unsupervised learning will be covered, although most of the course will be focused on supervised learning. Supervised learning will be examined for both classification and prediction problems. The basic ideas of neural networks will be presented. Machine learning from data streams \(online learning\) using stochastic gradient descent will also be covered.

Machine Learning II – Advanced topics in Machine Learning Professor: Panos Adamopoulos

This course delves into a number of selected current and emerging data analytics areas that are becoming increasingly important for modern organizations. Such areas include advanced elements of the predictive modeling process, ensemble methods, cost-aware data analytics, mining text and data, recommender systems, and other advanced topics.

Managing Big Data Professor: Panos Adamopoulos

Data management is the foundation of data-driven enterprises and a cornerstone for business analytics. Through this course, students will gain competence in practical database, data warehousing, and data management skills with emphasis on query, data modeling, ETL, and data management and they will also become familiar with major elements of the big data ecosystem.



Data Visualization Professor: Jesse Bockstedt

Data Visualization will introduce students to the techniques and tools used to create effective visualizations that clearly and efficiently communicate relationships within data. The field of data visualization combines the art of graphic design with the science of data analytics. Students will learn how to perform exploratory analysis through visualization, how to create professional looking visualizations for use in business reports and presentations, and how to design interactive visualizations and dashboards. The course will cover the common quantitative messages users attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated visualizations used to help communicate each message. These include time series, rankings, proportions, deviations, frequencies and distributions, correlations, categorical comparisons, and geospatial plots. Students will analyze real data sets and utilize R, Python, Tableau, and other tools to design and prototype their visualizations.
