## [Analytics: Discovery Informatics & Data Sciences](https://mbs.rutgers.edu/program/analytics-discovery-informatics-data-sciences)

### Overview

The Master's of Business and Science \(MBS\) degree in Analytics prepares students for data-driven decision making. The curriculum integrates courses in analytics/data science with courses in business and management, through a professionally guided curriculum. MBS gives students multiple hands on course projects that give them the opportunity to partner with companies, nonprofits, and government agencies. Students are also given the opportunity to do semester long projects through the MBS Externship Exchange program, open to working students, online students, and full/part time students. MBS courses are offered to help working professionals get ahead, with our courses being offered in the evenings and hybrid/online. The MBS Analytics curriculum brings together the fields of computer science, statistics, machine learning, data mining and big data. Students will obtain a variety of skills including the ability to analyze large datasets, the ability to develop modeling solutions to support decision making, and a thorough understanding of how data analysis drives business decision making.

**Analytics Pathways**

To assist students coming in with experiences in science or business areas, we have created pathways within the Analytics concentration to build on the student’s existing skills. All Analytics students must take the core business and science \(analytics\) courses, but within each pathway, students have required electives to assist in their professionally guided curriculum.

For students with a background in Engineering, Analytics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, and related areas, the student is guided towards our traditional Technical Analytics track where your advisor will work with you to come up with your professionally guided curriculum based on your experience, professional background, and career goals.

For students with a background in health/healthcare related areas \(undergrad degree in Biology, Pharmacy, Psychology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and related areas\), students are guided to our Health Informatics pathway.

For students with Finance related areas \(undergrad degree in Finance, Business, Economics, Accounting, Business Intelligence, or related areas\), students are guided to our Finance Analytics pathway.

#### EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES

Opportunities in analytics are plentiful in the tri-state area \(New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania\). This program prepares students for careers in predictive modeling, business intelligence, analytics, data mining in data-driven industries such as marketing, finance, health care, biotechnology and others. [See this 2018 blog about the different options in Analytics and the skills needed to succeed](https://mbs.rutgers.edu/node/615). [Understand how the skills differ by industry](https://mbs.rutgers.edu/articles/analytics-always-same-industry-based-exploration-skills-needed-analytics-jobs), and see below for detailed skills by industries relating to some of our Analytics Pathways. **Our students have excellent outcomes, with a 96% employment rate within 6 months of graduation, working for companies such as JP Morgan, Barclays Investment Bank, Bloomberg LP, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Saatchi & Saatchi Wellness, Deloitte, Accenture, and more.**

**Matching Skills to the Careers You Want:** We frequently perform labor analysis of skills requested by employers by industry. The four industries we target in a broad labor analysis match to our Analytics Pathways. These account for about 40% of the analytics roles requested by employers in 2018 \(see chart below\). These skills are utilized to help match students to electives and core courses. See [HERE](https://mbs.rutgers.edu/articles/analytics-always-same-industry-based-exploration-skills-needed-analytics-jobs) for further discussion on how we help match the skills you want to our courses.

### Admissions Requirements

**Technical Analytics:** A bachelor’s degree in Engineering, Engineering Management, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Operations Research, or related degree, with a GPA of at least 3.0 \(a B average\) and the GRE \(see also the admission requirements for the MBS\). **Students must have at least 1 year of calculus \(**2 semesters and can be taken [anywhere](https://mbs.rutgers.edu/sample-available-online-calculus-2-courses)**\).** Students must also have an undergraduate level programming course and statistics course for this track. Those without an undergraduate level course in both programming and statistics may need to take introductory course\(s\) which can count towards the degree.  Unsure if you're a good fit?
