## [M.S. in Statistics: Data Science](https://statistics.stanford.edu/academics/ms-statistics-data-science) <a id="page-title"></a>

##  <a id="page-title"></a>

The increasing importance of big data in engineering and the applied sciences motivates the Department of Statistics and ICME \(Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering\) to collaboratively offer a M.S. track that trains students in data science with a computational focus.

This focused M.S. track is developed within the structure of the current M.S. in Statistics and the M.S. program in ICME.

ADMISSIONS QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO [**stat-admissions-ms{at}LISTS\[.\]STANFORD\[.\]EDU&gt;&gt;&gt;**](https://statistics.stanford.edu/academics/ms-admissions-faq)

Upon the successful completion of the Data Science M.S. degree students will be prepared to continue on to a doctoral program in Statistics, ICME, MS&E, or Computer Science or as a data science professional in industry. Completing the M.S. degree gives no guarantee or preference for admission to the Ph.D. program.

Coursework

The Data Science track develops strong mathematical, statistical, computational and programming skills through the general master's core and programming requirements, in addition to providing fundamental data science education through general and focused electives requirement from courses in data sciences and related areas.

As defined in the general Graduate Student Requirements, students have to maintain a grade point average \(GPA\) of 3.0 or better and classes must be taken at the 200 level or higher. Students satisfying the course requirements of the Data Science track do not have to satisfy the other course requirements for the M.S. in Statistics

The total number of units in the degree is 45, 36 of which must be taken for a letter grade.

Submission of approved Master's Program Proposal, signed by the master's adviser, to the student services officer by the end of the first quarter of the master's degree program. A revised program proposal is required to be filed whenever there are changes to a student's previously approved program proposal.

There is no thesis requirement.

Students should submit a one-page proposal, supported by the faculty member and sent to the student's Data Science adviser for approval \(at least one quarter prior to start of project\).
* Master's Research: [STATS 299](https://exploredegrees-nextyear.stanford.edu/search/?P=STATS%20299) Independent Study.
* Project labs offered by Stanford Data Lab: [ENGR 250](https://exploredegrees-nextyear.stanford.edu/search/?P=ENGR%20250) Data Challenge Lab, and [ENGR 350](https://exploredegrees-nextyear.stanford.edu/search/?P=ENGR%20350) Data Impact Lab.
* Other courses that have a strong hands-on and practical component, such as [STATS 390](https://exploredegrees-nextyear.stanford.edu/search/?P=STATS%20390) Consulting Workshop up to 1unit.

Data Science Sample Schedules

The Data Science track schedule typically spans 5 quarters.

**5 quarter schedule for most students:  
Year 1:**  
Aut: CME 200, CME211, STATS200  
Wtr: CME212, CME307, STATS200  
Spr: STATS203 \(**18-19 AY**\), STATS315B, CME308, elective  
**Year 2:**  
Aut: CME302, STATS305A, HPC course \(or take CME213 in spring\), practical  
Wtr: CME305, STATS315A, practical, elective

**5 quarter schedule for students who are well prepared**:  
The student must have taken the equivalent of CME200 and STATS200 before starting the program.  
**Year 1:**  
Aut: CME211, STATS305A, elective  
Wtr: CME212, CME307, STATS200  
Spr: CME213, STATS315B, CME308  
**Year 2:**  
Aut: CME302, practical, elective  
Wtr: CME305, STATS263, STATS315A, elective

**4 quarter schedule:**  
This schedule is very demanding and students typically prefer the experience gained with a 5 quarter schedule.

The student must have taken the equivalent of CME200 and STATS200 \(Aut or Wtr\) before starting the program.  
**Year 1:**  
Aut: CME211, STATS305A, elective  
Wtr: CME212, CME305, CME307, STATS315A  
Spr: CME213, STATS315B, CME308, practical  
**Year 2:**  
Aut: CME302, elective \(2\), practical

Notes:

1. Because CME211 is the pre-requisite to CME212, those who take CME211 will be able to count it as an elective.
2. CME302 requires the equivalent of CME200 as prerequisite.
3. STATS305A requires the equivalent of STATS200 as prerequisite.
4. STATS315A requires the equivalent of STATS200 and \(STATS203 or 305A\) as prerequisite.
