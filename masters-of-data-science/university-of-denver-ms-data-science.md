#### Details about the MS in Data Science

* [Curriculum](https://ritchieschool.du.edu/academics-education/gr-programs/ms-data-science#)

  You’ll learn and develop comprehensive data science skills and knowledge, including programming, algorithms, machine learning, data mining, parallel and distributed systems, and data management. Not only will you learn how to use existing statistical and analytical tools necessary for evaluating and interpreting data, you will also learn how to build new tools that facilitate the use of data in making critical research, policy, and business decisions.

  Your learning will be reinforced with practical, hands-on team projects, giving you several opportunities to apply your skills to real world problems.

  A previous background in computer science is not required to apply.

  If you have previous coursework in Java programming, data structures, calculus, linear algebra and computer science theory, you can complete your degree in just nine months. Once admitted, you will take a placement exam to ensure you have mastery of the foundational concepts to ensure success in the program.

  **12 Courses \(48 Credits\)**

  * COMP 3421: Introduction to Database Management Systems
  * COMP 4333: Parallel and Distributed Computing
  * COMP 4431: Data Mining
  * COMP 4432: Machine Learning
  * COMP 4441: Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Data Science
  * COMP 4442: Advanced Probability and Statistics for Data Science
  * COMP 4447: Data Science Project 1
  * COMP 4448: Data Science Project 2
  * COMP 4449: Capstone Project in Data Science
  * COMP 4581: Algorithms for Data Science
  * Data Science Elective 1
  * Data Science Elective 2

  Choose from a variety of electives, including Computer Forensics, Bayesian Analysis, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and Programming Languages.

  If you do not have previous coursework in these subjects, you’ll take four bridge courses that will serve as a foundation for your data science courses, and you can complete the program in 12 months. If you plan to enroll in the bridge courses, you won’t take the placement exam until after completing this coursework.

  **Bridge courses \(16 credits if required\)**

  * COMP 3001: Computer Science Theory Basics
  * COMP 3005: Computer Science Programming Basics - Java
  * COMP 3006: Computer Science Advanced Programming - Advanced Java and Data Structures
  * COMP 3007: Data Science Theory Fundamentals - Calculus and Linear Algebra

  With an impressive mix of full-time university faculty, you’ll learn from instructors who are on the front lines of data science.
