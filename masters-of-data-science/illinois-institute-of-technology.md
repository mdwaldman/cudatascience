Other relevant 500-level coursework may be taken for elective credit, with approval of the program director.

Students must take a total of at least 9 credits of MATH coursework and at least 9 credits CS/CSP coursework to graduate, not including the capstone practicum course. Prerequisite courses [MATH 474](https://science.iit.edu/courses/math474), [CS 201](https://science.iit.edu/courses/cs201), and [CS 401](https://science.iit.edu/courses/cs401), if taken, will not count towards degree fulfillment.

To provide students with the best overall educational experience, the preferred course of study is on Illinois Tech's Mies Campus. We also offer the program online for students who are working full-time in data-related fields, in the U.S. or Canada. Direct coordination between the program and students’ employers is essential for student success. Overseas students are encouraged to take recommended prerequisite courses online, then come to Chicago for the main course of study.
