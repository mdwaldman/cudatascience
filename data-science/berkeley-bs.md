#### Description of the Undergraduate Major

The L&S undergraduate Data Science major requirements include one core lower-division \([Data 8](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8-foundations-data-science)\) and upper-division \([Data 100](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data100)\) course, along with required courses from each of the following groups:

* Foundations in Mathematics and Computing
* Computational and Inferential Depth
* Modeling, Learning and Decision Making
* Probability
* Domain Emphasis
* Human Contexts and Ethics



A student will be required to take **two courses** comprising **7 or more units** from a list of advanced courses providing computational and inferential depth \(C&ID\) beyond that provided in Data 100 and the lower division \(see below\).

It is recognized that, currently, some of these courses have prerequisites that are not formally within the major, so for some combinations  students may need to use electives to complete those. However, many options are available that do not place such demands.

* ASTRON 128. Astronomy Data Science Laboratory \(4 units\)

* COMPSCI 162. Operating Systems and Systems Programming \(4 units\)

fsdfs



A student will be required to take **one course** in probability. An understanding of probability is essential for dealing with uncertainty and randomness, the algebraic properties of estimation, the ability to formulate and comprehend stochastic simulations, and many other aspects of data science theory and practice. 

Acceptable courses:

* STAT 134. Concepts of Probability \(4 units\)
* STAT 140. Probability for Data Science \(4 units\)
* IND ENG 172. Probability and Risk Analysis for Engineers \(3 units\)

_dsfsdf_

\_\_

A student will be required to complete **one course** in modeling, learning, and decision-making.

Acceptable courses:

* COMPSCI 182. Designing, Visualizing, and Understanding Deep Networks \(4 units\)
* COMPSCI 189. Introduction to Machine Learning \(4 units\)
* IND ENG 142. Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Analytics \(3 units\)

_adfadf_

\_\_

Students will be required to take **one course** from a curated list of courses that establish a human, social, and ethical context in which data analytics and computational inference play a central role. The purpose of this requirement is to equip the student with an understanding of the human and social structures, formations, and practices that shape data science activity \(such as data collection and analysis, data stewardship and governance, work to ensure privacy and security, deployment of data in societal or organizational settings, decision-making with data, engagements of data with justice, practices of data ethics\) and to allow them to gain experience and practice with modes of critical thinking, reflection, and engagement with these experiences and the choices involved. 

Acceptable courses:

* AMERSTD/AFRICAM C134. Information Technology and Society \(4 units\)
* HIST C184D / STS C104. Human Contexts and Ethics of Data \(4 units\)
* INFO 188. Beyond the Data: Humans and Values \(3 units\)
* ISF 100J. The Social Life of Computing \(4 units\)
* PHILOS 121. Moral Questions of Data Science \(4 units\)

For certain Domain Emphases, additional HCE options are available \(see [domain emphasis](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis) pages for more details\):

* BIO ENG 100. Ethics in Science and Engineering \(3 units\)
* CY PLAN 101. Introduction to Urban Data Analytics \(4 units\)
* ESPM C167/PUB HLTH C160. Environmental Health and Development \(4 units\)
