\*\*\*\*[**Master of Science in Data Science**](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/graduate/ms.html)\*\*\*\*

### MS Program

Our Master of Science in Data Science program is accredited by New York State and provides a strong background in the both the fundamentals and applications of data science.

The program can be completed in either two semesters \(fall/spring\) or three semesters \(fall/spring/fall\) of full-time study. The two semester version is appropriate for students who enter with a strong background in computer science and mathematics, and are eager to take on a relatively heavy course load \(four courses per semester\) in order to graduate quickly. In the three semester version, students take three courses per semester, and many students work at internships during the summer between the spring and fall semesters. Our program provides opportunities for students to meet corporate recruiters and provides advice on applying for internships, but we do not guarantee placement in an internship.

The program is designed for students with a background in any field of science, engineering, mathematics, or business. We welcome mid-career applicants as well as students fresh out of college. Prospective students should have experience in programming, and should be comfortable with first-year college mathematics.

**The components of the program are as follows**:

* An optional summer bridging course for students who come without a strong computer science background.
* Four required [core courses](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/graduate/ms.html#core) for a total of 16 credits. Students may place out of one or more of the required core courses, but will still be required to complete the 30 credits required for the program.
* A required 4 credit [practicum](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/graduate/ms.html#practicum) in which the student works in a team to implement a significant system or analysis with a final oral presentation provided by each student. A committee of two faculty members from within the institute will evaluate the final oral presentation in order for it to serve as the masterâ€™s degree exit exam.
* Three electives selected from the [area courses](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/graduate/ms.html#area) or research, for a total of 10 credits or more. Some of the area courses have prerequisites that students must satisfy. Eight credits or more in one area would constitute a concentration, but a concentration is not required. 

A **total of 30 credits are required** to complete the program \(without the bridging course\) and many students will finish the program with more than 30 credits, depending on the elective area courses they select.

#### Optional Summer Bridging Course

* CSC 162: The Art of Data Structures\*

\*Students will be notified in their offer letter if they are required to take this course.  

#### Core Courses

* DSC 462: Computational Introduction to Statistics \(offered every fall\)
* DSC 465: Intermediate Statistical and Computational Methods \(offered every spring; prereq: DSC 462 or equivalent\)
* CSC 440: Data Mining \(offered fall and spring\)
* CSC 461: Database Systems \(offered fall and spring\)

#### Practicum

* DSC 483: Data Science [Practicum](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/research/sponsor.html) \(to be taken final semester, offered fall and spring\)

#### Area Courses

A minimum of 10 credits total required, across three areas. Eight or more of these credits in one specific area will qualify as a concentration though a concentration is not necessary for graduation. Students have the option to substitute an independent study \(DSC 491\) in place of an area course with the appropriate permissions.
