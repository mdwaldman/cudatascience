## WELCOME TO THEMASTER OF SCIENCE IN ANALYTICS PROGRAM \(MSIA\)

The Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering teaches students the skills that drive business success in today’s hyper-competitive, data-driven world.

Drawing on the expertise of many renowned professors and lecturers from major corporations, we combine mathematical and statistical studies with instruction in advanced data engineering and management. Students are immersed in a comprehensive and applied curriculum as they learn to:

* Perform data engineering and other fundamental data related processes on-premise and in the cloud
* Identify patterns and trends in data
* Apply artificial intelligence solutions including deep learning and reinforcement learning to introduce and deploy "machines" to augment human decision-making
* Develop and deploy innovative and creative analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence solutions within an business context
* Derive optimized data-driven recommendations
* Interpret and gain insight from vast quantities of structured and unstructured data by using advanced data science technologies and techniques
* Communicate findings in practical and useful terms that help businesses succeed

Supplemented by an internship and industry-supplied projects, graduates will be exceptionally well equipped to harness and communicate the full value of data to the organizations they serve.

</table>### WHY MSIA AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY?

The Master of Science in Analytics program is housed within the department of [Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/) at the [McCormick School of Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/). We are a full-time, 15-month professional master's degree with an applied data science curriculum. 

Many programs focus on just one aspect of analytics, producing graduates who are trained primarily in either modeling or data mining. Our program takes a broader, more comprehensive approach to analytics education. Coursework includes advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in addition to traditional applied statistical approaches. Students learn to think critically about matching techniques and programming solutions to business problems within an organizational context. To ground our curriculum in practical data science, our faculty use case studies of real-world analytics problems to foster discussion and refine mathematical, computing, and operational skills.

The Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University features study in all three areas of analytics: predictive, prescriptive, and descriptive. Industry access, including a practicum project, capstone project, and a required data science internship, allow students to immediately implement their new skills. The full-time, small cohort helps to foster a tight-knit community where students are able to share their strengths and build meaningful connections. Our customized curriculum taught by tenured faculty from the McCormick School of Engineering, the Kellogg School of Management, and the Medill School of Journalism, Media, and Integrated Marketing Communications combines data engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, and business. 

### DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

The Master of Science in Analytics program strives to foster an environment that values diversity and inclusion of all people.

## CURRICULUM <a id="page-title"></a>

The Master of Science in Analytics program is a full-time, on-campus program. Students in our program move through the coursework together as a cohort. The program spans five consecutive quarters, starting with a first fall quarter and ending with a second fall quarter. The first three quarters \(Fall, Winter, Spring\) are spent on campus taking required courses and working on an overarching practicum project in collaboration with fellow cohort members. During the 4th quarter \(Summer\) students spend a minimum of 10 weeks, fulfilling an internship within the industry. There is no tuition charged during this quarter. Finally, during the 5th quarter, the second fall quarter, Masters students will work on a capstone project, attend the last of their required course work, as well as attend an elective course of their choosing. 

The general timeline for classes and project work is shown below.
