## BUSINESS ANALYTICS

Business analytics is designed for students interested in learning how to manipulate, manage, and analyze data sets and models, and how to translate the derived knowledge and insight into business decision-making. 

You will gain tools for decision modeling and optimization and for data science. In this interdisciplinary concentration, you will then choose from a list of elective courses from statistics, marketing, operations, and business analytics. Coursework is at the forefront of this emerging area.

* Managerial Decision Modeling - This course teaches you frameworks for how to formulate managerial decision models that represent real-world problems in a wide range of business areas including operations, marketing, finance, and strategy. You will learn how to analyze and ultimately solve such decision models and to understand the managerial interpretations of your model solution. The skills you learn in this course will greatly enhance your analytical problem solving capabilities.
* Data Mining - This course centers on the analysis, exploration, and simplification of large high-dimensional datasets. You will learn how to model and interpret complicated big data and become adept at building powerful models for prediction and classification. Techniques covered include an advanced overview of linear and logistic regression, model choice and false discovery rates, multinomial and binary regression, classification, decision trees, factor models, clustering, the bootstrap, and cross-validation.
* Machine Learning - In this course, you will focus on techniques emphasizing how machine learning can be used to create value and provide insights from data in the context of business applications. You will focus on predictive analytics: decision trees, nearest neighbor classifiers, boosting, random forests, deep neural networks, naive Bayes, and support vector machines. You will also learn about unsupervised techniques for extracting actionable patterns from data, such as clustering, collaborative filtering, probabilistic graphical modelling and dimension reduction with applications to customer segmentation, recommender systems, graph and time series mining, and anomaly detection.
* Artificial Intelligence - There are many excellent courses that teach you the mechanics behind artificial intelligence. In this course, you will take a different approach by deploying these tools to foster understanding of what these tools do well and what they do badly. You will develop a functional, rather than mechanistic, understanding and be an expert at identifying ideal use-cases and thereby well-placed to create new products, businesses, and policies that use artificial intelligence. 
* Data Science for Marketing Decision Making - Marketing decisions in the era of big data are increasingly based on a statistical analysis of large amounts of transaction and customer data that provides the basis for profitability and ROI predictions. The goal of this class is to introduce modern data-driven marketing techniques and train you as a data scientist who can analyze data and make marketing decisions using some of the state-of-the-art tools that are employed in the industry. You will be exposed to a wide range of topics, including demand modeling, the analysis of household-level data, customer relationship management \(CRM\) and database marketing, and elements of digital marketing. The focus throughout is on predicting the impact of marketing decisions, including pricing, advertising, and customer targeting, on customer profitability and the return on investment \(ROI\) from a customer interaction.
