**SDS 378. Introduction to Mathematical Statistics.**

Same as [Mathematics 378K](http://catalog.utexas.edu/search/?P=M%20378K). Sampling distributions of statistics, estimation of parameters \(confidence intervals, method of moments, maximum likelihood, comparison of estimators using mean square error and efficiency, sufficient statistics\), hypothesis tests \(p-values, power, likelihood ratio tests\), and other topics. Three lecture hours a week for one semester. Only one the following may be counted: [Mathematics 378K](http://catalog.utexas.edu/search/?P=M%20378K), [Statistics and Data Sciences 378](http://catalog.utexas.edu/search/?P=SDS%20378), [Statistics and Scientific Computation 378](http://catalog.utexas.edu/search/?P=SSC%20378).
