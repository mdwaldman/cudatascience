## MS in Data Science Curriculum

## CURRICULUM

Degree requirements for the MS in Data Science can be found at [http://gsas.nyu.edu/bulletin/data-science/ms-data-science.html](http://gsas.nyu.edu/bulletin/data-science/ms-data-science.html).

The curriculum for the MS in Data Science \(MSDS\) degree is 36 credits. One of the key features of the MS in Data Science curriculum is a capstone project that makes the theoretical knowledge you gain in the program operational in realistic settings. During the project, you will go through the entire process of solving a real-world problem: from collecting and processing real-world data, to designing the best method to solve the problem, and finally, to implementing a solution. The problems and datasets you’ll engage with will come from real-world settings identical to what you might encounter in industry, academia, or government.

The MSDS also offers students the opportunity to pursue a track. Tracks allow you to connect with faculty who advise and help you plan your curriculum and career goals.  See below for more information.
