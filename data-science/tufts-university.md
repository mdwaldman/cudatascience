### B.S. Program

The Bachelor of Science in Data Science is a rigorous program open to students in the School of Engineering. The program requires 38 courses, including introductory, foundation, HASS, breadth, and concentration courses. The BSDS is designed both as a standalone major and a double major option for those students in Engineering who wish to add data science to an existing engineering major. Students adding Data Science as a second major must fulfill all of the requirements on the degree sheet, subject to double-counting rules.

Please see the [degree sheet](http://students.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/BSDS2022-DegreeSheet-091418.pdf) and [sample program](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/sites/default/files/BSDS_SampleProgram.pdf) for more details.

* **Introductory courses \(10 SHUs\)** include an Engineering 1 course; Engineering Science 2; Math 32, 36, 42, and 61; Physics 11; Chemistry 1 or 16; One of Physics 12, Chemistry 2, or Biology 13; and a natural science elective.  
* **The foundation requirement \(5 courses\)** includes Computer Science 11 and 15, Mathematics 70, one course in ethics and social context \(Philosophy 24 or Engineering Management 54\), and a statistics course chosen from MATH 162, EE 24 or 104.  
* **The Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts \(HASS\) requirement \(6 courses\)** includes English 1 or 3 and Ô¨Åve courses in Humanities, Arts, or Social Sciences. Of these five courses, one must be Humanities, one must be Social Science, and two must be in the same department.  
* **The disciplinary breadth requirement includes three courses** in a related application discipline including physics, biology, chemistry, and others. Each student must plan a set of three courses and petition the Data Science program directors for approval.  
* **The concentration requirement \(11 courses\)** includes Computer Science 40, 135, and 160, Math 128 or Computer Science 136, and five Data Science electives, three of which must be numbered above 100.  
  
  Those three must include:

  * A: One course in data infrastructure \(including Computer Science 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 51, and 151\)
  * B: One course in data analytics and/or interfaces \(including Computer Science 171, 175, 177, 52, and 152\)
  * C: One course in computational and theoretical aspects of data science \(including Math 123, 126; EE 109, 127, 140\) 

  
  ****Plus 2 additional courses:

  * From \(A\)-\(C\) as well as Math 51, 87, 151, 152, 155, 158, 161, 162; ME 150; or CEE 187; and at most one credit of Independent Study or Research \(COMP 93, 94, 191, 193, or 194; EE 93, 94, 95, 96, 191, 192\) and at most one credit of thesis \(COMP 197 or EE 197\) .  

* A capstone experience including the two courses Computer Science 87 and 88 \(Senior Capstone Project in Data Science I and II\) is required.

For a research experience, students should consider partly fulfilling concentration elective requirements via a senior thesis, coordinated with the capstone experience and breadth elective choices.  
  
**ABET accreditation**  
The B.S.D.S. is not accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission or Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. For an ABET-accredited degree, see the [Bachelor of Science in Computer Science \(B.S.C.S.\)](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/bachelor-science-computer-science-school-engineering), [Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering](http://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/undergraduate/majorBSCPE.htm) or [Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering](http://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/undergraduate/majorBSEE.htm).
