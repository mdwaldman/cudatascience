**MASTER OF SCIENCE IN APPLIED STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYTICS \(MASDA\)**

The explosion of data from sensors, the internet, business processes, surveys, medical instruments, social media, and other data collection devices, has created an ever increasing demand for specialists in applied statistics and data analytics.  In the next few years of this new “big data” era, there is anticipated need for an additional 200,000 professional statisticians \(a 50% increase\).

Now, Southern Methodist University offers a graduate degree that will give your career an edge in this exciting and highly competitive field of applied statistics and data analytics.

A Master of Science in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics \(MASDA\) degree from the Department of Statistical Science at SMU prepares you with the statistical foundation and critical thinking skills to tackle today’s problems and those that don’t even exist today.  If you have a background that is strong in mathematics, this degree program can help you take the next step to advance into this new and highly sought-after field.

A recent New York Times article has the headline [“For Today’s Graduate, Just One Word: Statistics.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/technology/06stats.html?_r=2&)  The article provides information about the demand for Internet-age statisticians.  In it, Hal Varian, chief economist at Google is quoted as saying, “I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians.  And I’m not kidding.”

[Time](http://business.time.com/2011/11/21/nine-jobs-of-the-near-future/) magazine lists statistician as one of the nine “Jobs of the \(near\) future.”  [Information Week ](http://www.informationweek.com/policy/big-datas-opportunities-responsibilities-for-education/d/d-id/1108756?)declares that there is a big demand for “Big Data” professionals who can extract information from data.
