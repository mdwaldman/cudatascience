# Data Science Curriculum

I’m particularly excited about how we’re incorporating the latest conference videos from Strata Data and The AI Conf. _**One of my biggest reservations about developing data science curriculum is that this kind of content goes stale so rapidly.**_ For example, the [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) project has a contract with the Apache Software Foundation that it must push a new release every 90 days. Consequently any book or video about Spark that’s 2 years old will already be 8 releases out of date. Leveraging the conference video ensures that these courses provide the latest and most relevant material, directly from the experts in the field and open source project leads.
