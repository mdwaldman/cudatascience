# University of Minnesota- Twin Cities

[Master of Science in Data Science](https://datascience.umn.edu/current-students/curriculum)

## About 

The M.S. in Data Science program provides a strong foundation in the science of Big Data and its analysis by gathering in a single program the knowledge, expertise, and educational assets in data collection and management, data analytics, scalable data-driven pattern discovery, and the fundamental concepts behind these methods. Students completing this regular 2 year \(31 credits\) master's program will learn the state-of-the-art methods for treating Big Data, be exposed to the cutting edge methods and theory forming the basis for the next generation of Big Data technology, and will complete a project demonstrating that they can use the fundamental concepts to design innovative methods for new application areas arising from business, government, security, medicine, biology, physical sciences, and the environment.

The Post-Baccalaureate Certificate is a rigorous program consisting of 4 courses \(12 credits\) providing a solid conceptual foundation to Data Science. This program is designed for those who want to learn the fundamentals of Big Data analytics as part time students while working full time, as well as those who are looking for a short 1 year program as full-time students.

### Capstone Project

Students must complete a capstone project supervised by a faculty member. One of the key features of the MS in Data Science curriculum is a capstone project that makes the theoretical knowledge gained in the program operational in realistic settings. During the project, you will go through the entire process of solving a real-world problem: from collecting and processing real-world data, to designing the best method to solve the problem, and finally, to implementing a solution. The problems and datasets you’ll engage with will come from real-world settings identical to what you might encounter in industry, academia, or government. Examples of projects and the wide variety of topics they cover can be found on the [research](https://datascience.umn.edu/overview/research) page.

A qualified advisor from outside Data Science may be selected with DGS approval. You may be asked to provide a CV for that potential advisor. Your final project report will be approved by a committee of three faculty including your advisor and including at least one member of the Data Science faculty. If not already on the Data Science faculty, your advisor may like to join \(they should send a short CV to the DGS\), otherwise you will need to find a current member acting as a co-advisor to approve the final report. In any case, the three committee members should represent at least two different departments. You will also be expected to give a short oral presentation on your project open to faculty, students and other interested parties.

### Data Science Major Coursework Credits

See [Courses](https://datascience.umn.edu/program/curriculum/courses) for a list of classes satisfying each category.

The Data Science program is 31 credits, 18 of which are required courses from three different tracks and 9 of which are electives. The program requires a total of 31 credits consisting of 6 credits each from the three emphasis areas: statistics, algorithms, and infrastructure and large scale computing; 9 credits in approved electives \(3 credits of electives must be 8000 level\); 1 credit of research colloquium; and 3 credits for the capstone project.  It is acceptable to take only 6 credits of electives and carry out a 6 credit capstone project spread over two semesters, if your project advisor agrees on the scope of your project. This "6-6" plan is the one generally followed by students admitted before 2017.  All other students will follow the "9-3" plan, unless they explicitly opt for the "6-6" plan with their advisor's concurrence.

| Total Credits for the Degree | 31 Credits |
| Minimum course credits that must be taken at the University of Minnesota | 19 Credits |

#### Academic Program Information

All credits must be 5000 level or above, with a GPA of at least 3.25. You must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 while a graduate student in this program.

This program may be completed with a minor.

Use of 4xxx courses towards program requirements is not permitted \(except as an elective by special petition\).

        <p>(Suggestions and pre-approved options are listed below. This is a non-exclusive
          list. An elective course is a course that explores more deeply concepts
          or methodologies addressed in a regular track course listed above, or a
          course that addresses tools or methodologies needed to make the methods
          above work, or a course in an application area outside data science in
          which issues of data management, data analysis, or data mining are discussed
          in the context of that application area. There are potentially many such
          courses around the University. Below are some suggestions. You may use
          any course listed above if not used to satisfy a track requirement. <b>To use a course not specifically listed as an elective, submit a short note explaining how the course meets one of these criteria together with a syllabus or other details of the course which lists the topics and the level at which the topics are taught.</b> The
