# Harvard Data Science

## [Master of Science in Data Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/graduate/applied-computation/master-of-science-in-data-science) <a id="page-title"></a>

**Under the joint academic leadership of the** [**Computer Science**](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) **and** [**Statistics**](http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/datascience) **faculties and administered through the** [**Institute for Applied Computational Science**](http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/) **\(IACS\), this three semester long master's program will train students in the rapidly growing field of data science.**   
  
Data Science lies at the intersection of statistical methodology, computational science, and a wide range of application domains.  The program offers strong preparation in statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, management and analysis of massive data sets, and data acquisition.  The program focuses on topics such as reproducible data analysis, collaborative problem solving, visualization and communication, and security and ethical issues that arise in data science.  
 

### **ADMISSIONS**

Students are admitted to the program through the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences](http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/) \(GSAS\). GSAS requires [online submission](http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/prospective_students/application_instructions_and_information.php) of applications for graduate study. In general, applicants must hold the BA or equivalent degree. GSAS considers students for admission to the fall term only.  

Applications to the Master of Science in Data Science degree program for entry into the program in Fall 2020 will be available in September of 2019.

SEAS will be hosting a series of in person information sessions for students interested in the Data Science master's \(as well as the Computational Science and Engineering and MS/MBA programs\) on the  following dates:

**Thursday, October 25th at 10:00am \(Maxwell Dworkin Room 323\)  
Tuesday, November 6th at 9:30am \(Maxwell Dworkin Room 123\)  
Thursday, November 29th at 9:30am \(Maxwell Dworkin Room 119\)**

These will be held on a walk-in basis, no registration is necessary. members of our admissions team will be on hand to answer questions about the degree programs and the application process.

Last year, IACS hosted an on-campus information session for prospective students.  [Watch the video of the program overview here](https://youtu.be/puE4j8L2OjE).   
 

### **LEARNING OUTCOMES**

The design of the program was developed through discussions between the computer science and statistics faculty and other Harvard departments and schools, including the [IACS Advisory Board](http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/iacs-advisory-board) and the [Data Science Education Committee](https://datascience.harvard.edu/faculty-committees). Each student's plan of study should address a set of learning outcomes developed from these discussions.  The learning outcomes answer the question: _"What should a graduate of our data science program be able to do?"_

* Build statistical models and understand their power and limitations
* Design an experiment
* Use machine learning and optimization to make decisions
* Acquire, clean, and manage data
* Visualize data for exploration, analysis, and communication
* Collaborate within teams
* Deliver reproducible data analysis
* Manage and analyze massive data sets
* Assemble computational pipelines to support data science from widely available tools
* Conduct data science activities aware of and according to policy, privacy, security and ethical considerations
* Apply problem-solving strategies to open-ended questions

### **DEGREE REQUIREMENTS**

Requirements for the SM degree in Data Science address these learning outcomes.  A total of 12 courses taken over at least three semesters is required.    
  
Each student's plan of study for the SM degree will include:

* The four technical [core courses](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/graduate/applied-computation/master-of-science-in-data-science/data-science-courses):
  * AC 209a Data Science I
  * AC 209b Data Science II
  * AM 207 Advanced Scientific Computing: Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference, and Optimization
  * CS 207 Systems Development for Computational Science
* AC221 Critical Thinking in Data Science
* At least one research experience.  This requirement can be satisfied by the AC 297r Capstone project course or a semester-length independent study project
* At least one Computer Science elective and one Statistics elective chosen from the [suggested electives list](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/graduate/applied-computation/master-of-science-in-data-science/data-science-courses)
* Up to one seminar course - AC 298r or similar
* Up to four other data science electives \(from other FAS departments or other schools at Harvard\)
* As a final requirement, the presentation of a poster on a data science project at the annual IACS Project Showcase
