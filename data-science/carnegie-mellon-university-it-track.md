# Carnegie Mellon University - IT track

**M**[**aster of Information Systems Management: Business Intelligence & Data Analytics**](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-technology-master/right-for-me)\*\*\*\*

The Master of Science in Information Technology \(MSIT\) is a part-time, distance learning program that is ideal for current IT professionals seeking to add business acumen, management, and targeted problem-solving skills to their portfolios. MSIT can also be a great fit for professionals from less technical areas, such as finance and health care, who wish to pivot toward technology-intensive roles and improve their analytical skills.

All admitted MSIT students will have **at least three years** of relevant professional experience. However, many incoming students have eight or more years.

The MSIT program is designed with working professionals in mind, delivered via an asynchronous "Anytime, Anywhere" distance learning model for maximum flexibility. This approach allows MSIT students to customize their degree and complete the program on a schedule that fits into their lives.

Students living in or near the greater Pittsburgh area may choose to complete the MSIT program in a hybrid format, combining online and on-campus classes.
