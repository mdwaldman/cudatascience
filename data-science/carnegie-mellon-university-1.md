## MBA Curriculum

As a Tepper MBA student, you can customize your degree by selecting concentrations based on areas of interest.

Students are required to complete one concentration, but most students pursue three or four. A concentration is not declared; once you take three or more elective classes in a subject area, your concentration is automatic.
