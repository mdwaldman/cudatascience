[Statistical & Data Sciences Major](https://www.smith.edu/sds/major.php)



* Foundations and Core \(5 courses\): The following required courses build foundational skills in mathematics, statistics, and computer science that are necessary for learning from modern data.
  * CSC 111: Intro to Programming
  * SDS 192: Intro to Data Science
  * MTH 211: Linear Algebra
  * MTH/SDS 220 or SDS 201: Introductory Statistics
  * MTH/SDS 291: Multiple Regression
* Programming Depth \(1 course\): One additional course that deepens exposure to programming.
  * CSC 212: Data structures
  * CSC 220: Advanced Programming Techniques
  * CSC/SDS 235: Visual Analytics -- must take programming intensive track
  * CSC/SDS 293: Machine Learning
  * CSC/SDS 352: Parallel & Distributed Computing
* Statistics Depth \(1 course\): One additional course that provides exposure to additional statistical models.
  * MTH/SDS 290: Research Design and Analysis
  * CSC/SDS 293: Machine Learning
  * SDS 390: Topics in SDS
    * Categorical Data Analysis
    * Structural Equation Modeling
    * Statistical Analysis of Social Networks
* Communication \(1 course\): One course that focuses on the ability to communicate in written, graphical, and/or oral forms in the context of data.
  * CSC/SDS 109: Communicating with Data \(formerly 136\)
  * CSC/SDS 235: Visual Analytics
  * SDS 236: Data Journalism
* Application Domain \(1 course\): Every student is required to take a course that allows them to conduct a substantial data analysis project evaluated by an expert in a specific domain of application. The requirement is normally satisfied by one of the following options:

  * SDS 300: Applications of Statistical & Data Sciences
  * A research seminar \(normally 300-level\) or special studies of at least two credits. Normally, the domain would be outside of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
  * A departmental honors thesis in another major \(normally not including MTH or CSC\)

  A student and their advisor should identify potential application domains of interest as early as possible, since many suitable courses will have prerequisites. Normally, this should happen during the 4th semester or at the time of major declaration, whichever comes first. The determination of whether a course satisfies the requirement will be made by the student's major advisor.

  A non-exhaustive list of previously approved application domain courses:

  * SDS 300: Applications of Statistical & Data Sciences
    * Population Health: Data & Analysis
  * PSY 301: Research Design and Analysis
  * PSY 358: Research Seminar in Clinical Psychology
  * PSY/SDS 364: Research Seminar on Intergroup Relationships
  * ECO 311: Seminar: Topics in Economic Development
  * ECO 319: Seminar: Economics of Migration
  * ECO 363: Seminar: Inequality
  * EGR 389: Data Mining
  * BIO 334: Bioinformatics & Comparative Mol Bio
  * NSC 318: Neurobiology

* Capstone \(1 course\): Every student is required to complete a capstone experience, which exposes them to real-world data analysis challenges.
  * SDS 410: Capstone
