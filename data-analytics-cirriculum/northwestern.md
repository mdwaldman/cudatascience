## CURRICULUM <a id="page-title"></a>

The Master of Science in Analytics program is a full-time, on-campus program. Students in our program move through the coursework together as a cohort. The program spans five consecutive quarters, starting with a first fall quarter and ending with a second fall quarter. The first three quarters \(Fall, Winter, Spring\) are spent on campus taking required courses and working on an overarching practicum project in collaboration with fellow cohort members. During the 4th quarter \(Summer\) students spend a minimum of 10 weeks, fulfilling an internship within the industry. There is no tuition charged during this quarter. Finally, during the 5th quarter, the second fall quarter, Masters students will work on a capstone project, attend the last of their required course work, as well as attend an elective course of their choosing. 

The general timeline for classes and project work is shown below.
