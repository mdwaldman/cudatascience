## Data Science and Analytics

#### OFFERED ON CAMPUS, ONLINE OR AS A COMBINATION

Big Data â€“ two small words that can have a major impact on how companies make key decisions.

Organizations large and small employ data scientists to determine profitable lines of business, characterize customers, evaluate and predict risks, improve operational efficiencies, predict system performance and perform complex simulations.

Data Science and Analytics is the development of analytical models and methods to extract new knowledge from vast, complex data.

The University of Oklahoma is proud to offer a Graduate Certificate in Data Science and Analytics, and a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics.  Current OU students can complete a dual degree or add our certificate.

Course offerings come from a collaboration between the Schools of Computer Science and Industrial and Systems Engineering.  Graduates will have the skills to design and build tools to extract, assimilate and analyze data, and the systems understanding to predict and enhance future performance for enterprises across all domains of the private and public sectors.
