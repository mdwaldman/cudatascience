  **MGMT 57000: Spreadsheet Modeling and Simulation**

  In the past eighteen years, _Excel_ spreadsheets have become the standard tool that business people use to model and analyze quantitative problems. The latest versions of these spreadsheet packages contain powerful analytical tools that could be possible only with mainframe computers and mathematically trained personnel more than a decade ago. This course covers up-to-date and practical spreadsheet modeling and simulation tools that can be applied to a wide variety of business problems in finance, marketing, and operations. The topical coverage mainly consists of the following four modules: \(1\) deterministic and stochastic optimization techniques to determine the best managerial actions under internally- and/or externally-imposed constraints; \(2\) probability distribution fitting techniques to find the most likely description of the uncertainty in future business; \(3\) simulation modeling techniques to discover and analyze the risk and uncertainty in business environment and processes; \(4\) application of spreadsheet modeling and simulation techniques in forecasting asset dynamics \(stock price\) and pricing options and real investment opportunities. This course provides hands-on experience of computer applications using Microsoft _Excel_ and the spreadsheet add-ins _@RISK, RISKOptimizer, SimQuick_, etc.

  **MGMT 57100: Data Mining w/SAS Enterprise Miner**

  Simon \(1977\) stated that managerial decision-making is synonymous with the entire process of management. In order to make intelligent decisions, one must have access to data and information. Today’s electronically networked world provides a nearly infinite number of opportunities for data collection. The issue thus becomes: How does one approach these large quantities of data with the purpose of intelligent decision-making? The purpose of this course is to introduce the _concepts, techniques, tools_, and _applications_ of data mining. The material is approached from the perspective of a business analyst, with an emphasis on supporting tactical and strategic decisions.

  **MGMT 58200: Management of Organizational Data**

  This course provides the basic concepts and skills needed to analyze and organize business data, as well as to utilize the organized data to answer a variety of business queries. After successful completion of the course, students will be able to appreciate why database management is important, analyze the data requirements of a business scenario and represent these requirements by means of entity-relationship \(ER\) diagrams, translate an ER diagram into normalized tables for a relational database management system, and write simple and relatively complex data retrieval commands in the SQL language for Oracle and Microsoft Access databases. The major ideas and techniques will be reinforced through the work on successive segments of a group project. Each student group will also research a current topic in business data management and make a presentation on this topic in class.

  **MGMT 59000: Communication and Persuasion**

  The Communication and Persuasion course enhances student professionalism in business contexts by improving oral communication skills. In this special course designed for MS BAIM students, you will focus on developing and presenting data driven messages that are professional, clear, concise, and persuasive. By the end of the course, you will develop your ability to:

  * present yourself professionally in diverse business communication contexts \(e.g., presentations, group discussions, informal interactions, etc.\)
  * explain data and analyses in ways that are clearly understood by receivers
  * provide concise explanations that quickly get to the point without losing important context or content
  * demonstrate mastery at being data driven by \(a\) translating data and analyses into a narrative that provides context for your message AND \(b\) creating informative, clutter‐free data visualizations to support your message
  * make persuasive recommendations that convince receivers to adopt a particular belief or take a course of action

  **MGMT 67000: Business Analytics**

  Data analysis and modeling are important skills for effective managerial decision making in business and industry. Advances in technology \(computers, scanners, cell phones\) have made significant amount of data available to managers. For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the best-known and most widely watched indicators of the direction in which stock market values are heading. Administration and Congressional policymakers rely on statistics for budget decisions and related fiscal policy choices. The Federal Reserve System bases the monetary policy on data analysis. A manager needs to know if the manufacturing process is producing a quality product based on monitoring and assessing process performance. A sales manager has to develop tools to regularly monitor the performance of sales force. A Manufacturer of certain electronic products needs to produce a forecast of future sales in order to decide whether or not to expand production. Banks use customer data to identify and design lucrative banking products. These are a few of the many examples from business where statistics can improve company performance. The techniques learnt in this course will help you infer data and as such make better informed decisions. The course covers basic probability, decision analysis, statistical analysis \(hypothesis testing and regression analysis\), and simulation and provides an introduction to optimization techniques. Probability models provide tools to handle uncertainty and risk. Statistical analysis focuses on the presentation of data and techniques to draw useful and valid inferences from data. Optimization models and decision analysis focus on techniques that use data to inform decision-making.

  **MGMT 67200: Advanced Business Analytics w/SAS**

  The objective of this course is to familiarize you with analytical models and statistical software \(SAS and Minitab\) that are used frequently in decision making and in empirical study. The focus of the course is on the appropriate means of applying these analytical methods to aid in arriving at decisions. Underlying theoretical concepts are brought forward and demonstrated to understand important methodology. Students are expected to have completed MGMT 670 or equivalent as a prerequisite. The materials in this course are intended to have some initial overlap with the content of 670. The overlap will be used to both review fundamental concepts of General Linear Models \(Multiple Regression\) and introduce you to the analytical software system SAS. While there are a multitude of advanced linear models concepts, this course will focus on model building using \(1\) _Independent Indicator Variables_ \(ANOVA, ANCOVA, Blocking Designs, Factorial Designs, Piecewise Linear Regression, and Splines\) \(2\) _Dependent Indicator Variables_ \(Linear Probability Model, Logistic Regression, and Cumulative Logistic Regression\), \(3\) _Forecasting and Time Series Models_ \(Autoregressive, Moving Average, ARIMA and Cross-Correlation models\), and \(4\) _Volatility Models_ \(ARCH and GARCH, GARCH-M, IGARCH, EGARCH\).

  **MGMT 68300: Management Information Systems**

  The Internet and other information technologies have reshaped the economic, organizational, cultural and personal landscape. Managers, consultants, and entrepreneurs are all expected to effectively utilize the technology to achieve the organizational goals. Organizations are now expected to not just adapt to technology changes, but also innovate taking advantage of the benefits of the technology and thrive using their new capabilities. Accordingly, the objective of the course is from the perspective of the Information Technology Executive Leadership interested in enhancing the organization’s competitive advantage. Specifically, in the course, we will study in detail what the different types of technologies are, how they can be taken advantage of, and what the critical success factors are for successful implementation of each type. The course material will be delivered by using case-discussions, lectures, and examples.

  **MGMT 69000: IT Project Management**

  Given the increasing complexity of business and technology environments, it is very challenging for project managers to complete mission-critical projects on time and within budget, while satisfying clients and stakeholders. This course helps students understand and develop the important body of knowledge and skills in project management by learning useful concepts, frameworks, theories, principles, methodologies, techniques, and tools within the context of IT. Upon completion of this course, they will know the key aspects of a project as identified by the Project Management Institute’s \(PMI\) Project Management Body of Knowledge \(PMBOK\) and will be able to effectively manage IT-intensive business projects.

[MGMT 65000: Strategic Management IStrategic Management is concerned with understanding how organizations might achieve advantage relative to competitors. In particular, it deals with the organization, management, and strategic positioning of the firm so as to gain long-term competitive advantage. To address this issue, we take on the role of general managers, or integrators – that is, managers who make decisions that cut across the functional and product boundaries of a firm. By focusing on what makes managers effective, we shall develop the ability to evaluate different situations and give you usable skills regardless of the business context in which you want to work. Strategic management issues that we will consider include the following: How can my firm create value \(e.g., low cost or differentiation; using resources; integrating activities correctly\) relative to the competition? How do other players in the industry impact the amount of value I capture from my activities? How can the firm identify new opportunities for value creation and value capture and implement those activities within the firm? How can a corporation create \(rather than destroy\) economic value through its multimarket activities?
