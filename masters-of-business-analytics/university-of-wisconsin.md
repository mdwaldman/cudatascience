Other graduate business schools with STEM programs include those at the [University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/university-of-wisconsin-madison-01245) and [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/worcester-polytechnic-institute-01378) in Massachusetts.

A formal STEM designation for college degree programs was launched during the Obama administration as a way to enhance America's leadership in fields like computer programming, the biological sciences and engineering. The designation was initially designed to attract [international students](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/studying-in-the-united-states/features/studying-at-a-us-graduate-school) by allowing those who qualify to live and work in the U.S. for additional time after graduation. But MBA programs that carry the STEM designation are finding that it has attracted applicants from within the U.S., too.
