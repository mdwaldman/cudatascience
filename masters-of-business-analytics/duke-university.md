### Bridge the analytics-business gap

While any good analyst is trained to gather data and report findings, the MQM: Business Analytics curriculum is designed to give you an edge—ensuring you’re equally comfortable analyzing the data, collaborating with teammates, and persuading managers to act on your insights. The difference comes from our focus across three areas:

* **Technical:** Learning tools that facilitate data analysis
* **Functional:** Building expertise in the context of a specific industry or function
* **Critical thinking and communication:** Knowing the right questions to ask and presenting insights effectively

With project work and experiences that take you outside your comfort zone, you’ll become a better communicator, critical thinker, and team player as you strengthen your quantitative skills.

#### **Course Highlights**

Explore a selection of the core courses available to you.[Foundational Business Courses](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/%23)

Designed as a core platform that supports your career track studies, these courses provide a broad perspective on business.

**Critical Thinking, Communication, and Collaboration**

This course provides a grounding in three skills that will serve you well in both analysis and in life.

#### **Electives**

Elective courses will be available starting in the second term, or later depending on your career discipline, and will give you more breadth in analytics beyond your area of expertise. You will be able to choose your elective courses from MQM: Business Analytics course offerings specific to other tracks.

#### **Capstone Project**

The MQM: Business Analytics program culminates in a capstone project, a 6-week intensive project in which teams of students partner with a faculty advisor and an organization to solve a specific problem utilizing analytics techniques. The capstone is designed to give students the opportunity to utilize the domain-specific tools developed throughout the program in a real-world environment in which they are exposed to the challenges inherent to the modern data environment.

#### **Teaching Methods**

Our MQM: Business Analytics faculty bring your courses to life through lectures, class discussions, and case-based learning. Your professors will use actual business problems, leverage interdisciplinary perspectives, and help you understand how data is currently being used to transform all areas of business. The case-based learning method uses real-world business cases as the basis for discussions and team projects. This approach challenges you to see business problems from a corporation's perspective and to take what you learn in class to develop quantitatively supported recommendations. Because so much of your learning happens through debate and analysis, you’re expected to be an active participant in class discussion. As a result you’ll learn to think practically, critically, and creatively, preparing you to tackle business problems from multiple perspectives.
